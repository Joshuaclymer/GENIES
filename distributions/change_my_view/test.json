            "It isn't necessarily logical to say I don't know therefore I have to be open to all possibilities because there are an infinite possibilities.    It would be more logical to say I don't know and there is no possible way to know therefore rather than chase odds of 1 out of infinity of being right I will instead focus on other things.  It is a fallacy that religions can deliver morals because every religion is different.  When those who say yeah but we all agree that we should not murder children therefore it had to come from somewhere completely discount the feelings including empathy when a person has their child murdered.  We have eye for eye justice sanctioned by many a Christian supporting capital punishment.  How there can be such a big disconnect in morality between the Christian sects on that issue baffles me.

            "Agnosticism is a stance about knowledge. It's the short version of \"I have no proof that God exist or don't\".  To me, this stance is incomplete, because you don't define \"God\" precisely enough. For some definitions of God (for example: \"*the bearded immortal wizard that created the world in 6 days 6000 years ago*\"), you have proof that this God does not exist because that's not how the world was created. Therefore, you are gnostic about the non-existence of God: it does not exist. For a definition like \"*God is the force that make all of us walk on earth instead of flying*\", then you know that God exist: God is \"gravity\". So you are gnostic about the existence of God: it exists.  A better position would be IMO to be ignostic: \"*there is no coherent and unambiguous definition of gods, therefore having knowledge and/or belief on something like that makes no sense*\". Then, once you get a useful definition, you can answer the question": 1.0

During the debates they should ask both candidates things like \"What is the current federal debt\" as well as a geography section where they are given a list of countries to point to (specifically countries with US military installations/deployments)  Even some SAT level math questions or reading comprehension/LSAT logic based questions could give a side by side comparison of the cognitive capabilities would be a completely unbiased way to compare them.  To be clear, I'm not advocating people vote solely based off intelligence/cognitive capability, but I would imagine it would be a factor in the decision making process, and in the day of fake news and claims like \"I took a cognitive test and it was the highest score ever\" it would be interesting to have a true side by side comparison of the candidates.\n### Comment:\n",

Generally speaking the purpose of a modern prison is to a combination of 2 and 3, its to keep the dangerous people in a controlled environment away from the public (e.g murders) and its there to help reform prisoners on lesser offenses and turn them into functioning members of society.  What you see as reading a few books is actually full scale programs designed to give them skills and to help them become psychologically normal.  I think the big problem with your view is you see a prisoner as an other who has done a some what evil act and must be punished.  What the modern system would say is look at their background meaning the hardships they grew up in, the abuse they themselves experienced and help them change their life for the better.  Ultimately the reform approach is there to stop them from becoming repeat offenders (which drains the tax payer) and have them functioning members of society who actually contribute tax payments.": 1.0,

Your stated opinion would be that breeding, say, German shepherds so they were still aesthetically pleasing and yet still functioning animals, would still be classed as animal cruelty. This would also require the \"continuous breeding\" of the breeds, which you seem to abhor, and yet it would *fix* many of the root causes of this dislike by increasing quality of life for the animals.   Lazy breeding strategies, and a lack of understanding of genetics among breeders, has led to the current state of affairs. But, as mentioned here, why should that mean that we cannot solve the issues in general? You *can* solve these issues while still producing cute (allegedly) pugs; to think otherwise is shortsighted and unimaginative.": 1.0

Pugs even have a distinctive raspy breathing sound because they cannot breathe properly a lot of the time, which is no life for any animal.   If they suffer from chronic pains and illnesses, why should breeds of dogs be continuously bred, which also makes the problem worse because future generations get progressively more screwed up. \"Because I want a pug\" is not a valid reason to continue their suffering, just as how it is cruel to keep certain animals in captivity since the conditions mean they struggle, or how puppy mills are cruel and completely disregard animal welfare.\n### Comment:\n",

CoonTown got about 500 000 unique views last month and has about 24k subs.  These users affect reddit in general and they make it worse. If you don't think they do, then please read through some of this IamA with a German refugee worker.  If Reddit banned all of these hate subs (and any new ones) then of course the users would blow up, but just like the FPH drama it would die down within a week or two. Then these racists would leave and reddit would be better.  Everybody comes to reddit initially because of some link/thread that they got from somewhere else. As long as reddit still hosts large racist communities (and hosts them ad-free no less) then the number of racists on the entire site will only grow.   **TL;DR - The ban process wouldn't be perfect, but I think that reddit's policy should be \"we don't want racists here. Go somewhere else.\" Instead of their current policy which is \"racists are totally fine, please enjoy your ad-free experience which is subsidised by other content\".**\n### Comment:\n",

But I think calling the mere creation of pugs animal cruelty is going a bit too far. Animal cruelty seems to me to require actions that are deliberately cruel--abuse, neglect, fighting, failure to give them medical treatment, etc. Merely creating a dog likely to have--but not guaranteed to have--health issues that range extensively in severity doesn't make the cut.   Responsible breeders are attempting to cross mates that will result in healthier, sturdier animals. I would encourage the kennel clubs to change the conformation standards to push these changes even faster.

            "Do you know how conservationists try to fix inbred animals which people don't want to see disappear? I'll give you a hint, it's not by refusing to breed them at all.   Snark aside, breeding comes in all shapes and sizes, and many (not all) of the features which we consider as 'pug features' or 'German shepherd features' are not the same ones which lead to genetic conditions. Your stated opinion would be that breeding, say, German shepherds so they were still aesthetically pleasing and yet still functioning animals, would still be classed as animal cruelty. This would also require the \"continuous breeding\" of the breeds, which you seem to abhor, and yet it would *fix* many of the root causes of this dislike by increasing quality of life for the animals.   Lazy breeding strategies, and a lack of understanding of genetics among breeders, has led to the current state of affairs. But, as mentioned here, why should that mean that we cannot solve the issues in general? You *can* solve these issues while still producing cute (allegedly) pugs; to think otherwise is shortsighted and unimaginative.": 1.0

I never understood that. European style is to keep the duvet just lying on the bed. It is much faster to make a bed that way and it makes it easy to wrap yourself for added coziness.  Edit: Okay, everyone, calm down. Tucking the duvet in is not Europe vs US thing. Apparently I did not sleep in enough beds to get a full picture.": 1.0

Why make your bed to just get in it again? Apart from discipline and neatness, I don\u2019t see why to make your bed.  I also find that my covers fall less when I don\u2019t make my bed. Plus, it also feels cosier when it\u2019s not made. On top of that, the bed is tighter and you can\u2019t feel loose to roll around as much in bed.  Overall, I think making my bed is wasting my time just so I can be colder (due to falling covers) and more uncomfortable.   However, I know that my opinion is flawed so I would appreciate it if someone explains why I should make my bed.\n### Comment:\n",

It seems to me hypocritical to believe that Trump is unfit for office and abused his power and then proceeds to potentially give him more power--or at least extending the duration of his current powers.   Additionally, Representative Justin Amash attempted to amend the budget bill by removing the Patriot Act language but the amendment was blocked by the Democrats on the Rules Committee. Only 10 Democrats voted against the resolution, including AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Tlaib.   The Trump administration still retains authority to reinitiate the NSA call records program, the program where millions of innocent American calls had been collected, if they deem it necessary.   Given the fact that the Trump administration could potentially extend another 4 years, it seems questionable at best why Democrats would not strip him of some of the powers he could abuse when they had the opportunity to.

However, just yesterday, the House of Representatives voted to fund and extend the Patriot Act for an extended 3 months after December 20th.   It seems to me hypocritical to believe that Trump is unfit for office and abused his power and then proceeds to potentially give him more power--or at least extending the duration of his current powers.   Additionally, Representative Justin Amash attempted to amend the budget bill by removing the Patriot Act language but the amendment was blocked by the Democrats on the Rules Committee. Only 10 Democrats voted against the resolution, including AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Tlaib.   The Trump administration still retains authority to reinitiate the NSA call records program, the program where millions of innocent American calls had been collected, if they deem it necessary.   Given the fact that the Trump administration could potentially extend another 4 years, it seems questionable at best why Democrats would not strip him of some of the powers he could abuse when they had the opportunity to. Given this, it seems to me most of the rhetoric against Trump is just for show. When presented with something to act on, most of the Democrats chose to empower Trump, and allow his administration the power to listen and collect calls, information, and data on millions of Americans.\n### Comment:\n",

My theory is that there are actually many \u2018the ones\u2019 in each city. It\u2019s just a matter of whom you happen to meet first out of that pool of people.   Most of us know someone who has been widowed. Many of those widows/widowers will eventually remarry or at least settle down with someone else. They often feel as though their second spouse is just as right for them as their first, sometimes even more so. How does that make sense when they believed their previous spouse was \u2018the one\u2019 until the day they died? It makes sense because there isn\u2019t a singular \u2018one\u2019, there are a lot of them. We just aren\u2019t aware of the others.   There are situations in which little details seem to confirm that someone is indeed the one and only love of their life. For example; \u201cMy wife and I grew up in the same town but didn\u2019t know each other but met on vacation 4000 miles away. And it turns out our grandfathers used to be best friends!\u201d But let\u2019s be real - coincidences happen every day. Odd ones. Far-fetched ones. But they happen. And they serve to make us feel even more secure in the relationship.\n### Comment:\n",

Others have covered why they aren't taking other's vaccines, but I'll touch slightly more on this. This statement is absolutely false. The science is not *conclusive* that an extra dose is *the best public health policy* (though it is suggestive and competent public health agencies (in other words, not the CDC) are authorizing them). All the science in the world, however, points that a 4th dose will be beneficial and increasingly so as time passes from the 3rd dose. There are, of course, studies suggesting it:  https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-study-finds-fourth-dose-covid-19-vaccine-boosts-antibodies-five-fold-pm-2022-01-04/  And then there is the simple fact that we understand the mechanism - antibodies constitute an important part of your immune system's protection (though not the entirety of it), and deplete over time.

The crime itself should be abolished, although it could be used as a factor when sentencing someone for the crime the were initially stopped for.  Many people, men in particular, have grown up in tough circumstances where they must constantly stand up to bullies and abuse. And when being confronted by officers barking orders at them, it's difficult to switch instincts off and be submissive. Yet police will often treat the slightest hint of autonomy, such as stiffening muscles or twisting as \"resisting arrest.\"  We have seen countless videos of suspects being taken down and manhandled by police who are screaming \"stop resisting\" although the suspect is clearly not resisting. This has become a tactic in their training to create the perception among bystanders that the person was resisting arrest.

We have seen time and time again that police have abused this law to bring into custody and charge people in the absence of probable cause for any other crime,  and to use it to extract concessions. The crime itself should be abolished, although it could be used as a factor when sentencing someone for the crime the were initially stopped for.  Many people, men in particular, have grown up in tough circumstances where they must constantly stand up to bullies and abuse. And when being confronted by officers barking orders at them, it's difficult to switch instincts off and be submissive. Yet police will often treat the slightest hint of autonomy, such as stiffening muscles or twisting as \"resisting arrest.\"  We have seen countless videos of suspects being taken down and manhandled by police who are screaming \"stop resisting\" although the suspect is clearly not resisting. This has become a tactic in their training to create the perception among bystanders that the person was resisting arrest.  People who have claimed police abuse have been required to sign away their rights and drop abuse claims in order to get \"resisting arrest\" charges dropped.  The police would still have other tools to protect themselves and the judicial process.

Yes, wired charging does a better job charging than wireless charging in just about every way (heat, time spent charging, ability to move phone while charging, etc).  Instead you should compare wireless charging to your phone sitting around not charging. Why?  Because I never think \"I need to charge my phone, let me put it on the wireless charger\".  I just sit at my desk and toss my phone on the wireless charging dock.  If I need to use my phone, I take it off the charging dock same as I'd take it off my desk, except in the meantime the wireless charger has increased my charge instead of letting it slowly decrease.  Because of this its very rare that my phone gets so low that I feel like I need to charge it. This really only happens when I've been out doing things all day.

The toothbrush itself is often wet when placed back in the charger, and the bathroom in general can be a super moist environment after a shower.  Those aren't great conditions for exposed metal electrical connectors.    With wireless charging, there's no exposed metal connectors to rust or short out if the appliance is wet - it's a big advantage over plugging it in.  The slow charge time isn't an issue at all for bathroom appliances, since you use them once and then they're right back in the charger.    So, useless?

You will notice thus particularly if you move from a business with no dress code or a relaxed one to a more strict one; when you get dressed in the morning, for many anyway, it becomes a transition to a more businesslike attitude, which will endure for the rest of the day, until you come home and remove your \"monkey suit\" and relax.

But if you respond to potential dates with people who don't make a lot of money *disrespectfully*, while still expecting respect for your own self who also doesn't make a lot of money, *that* is where the hypocrisy comes in. Imagine someone giving reaction like \"ew... you only make minimum wage\", but then being offended if someone were to say the same thing to them. And I think its not hard to find situations like this. Its less about the requirements themselves and more how you treat and talk about the people who don't meet them.

The problem with this is that this state is it we\u2019re to exist, would be an oppressive, secular state with little acceptance for LGBTQ, women, and other minorities.  Because of the religious extremism and the traditional views that would be held by its citizens and those in power, these groups would be marginalized.  I\u2019ve quoted below about the treatment of LGBTQ and women in Palestine and Gaza from Amnesty International.  \u201cMeanwhile, Section 152 of the Penal Code applicable in Gaza criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual activity and makes it punishable by up to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d   \u201cWomen and girls faced discrimination in law and practice and were inadequately protected against sexual and other gender-based violence, including so-called honour killings.\u201d  \u201cPalestinian security forces in the West Bank and Gaza routinely used torture and other ill-treatment with impunity. \u201c\n### Comment:\n",

Add in a toilet paper roll dispenser, sink, hand-dryer, garbage, changing table, etc. and space does become a factor, especially in smaller washrooms.    There are also aesthetic differences - type of soap, type of artwork, whatever.  And you may think those don't matter, but when you're talking about a restaurant or whatever, the entire experience absolutely matters and little things like that can affect business.

We all know that productivity, energy, and morale dwindle in the afternoon, which, sure, wouldn't happen if everyone got the full 8 Hours of sleep at night, but let's be honest, who does that?   There's really not much of a downside that I can see, because the increase in productivity more than makes up for the lost 20 minutes.  In fact, a 20 minute nap at noon actually decreases the amount of sleep needed at night to be healthy from 8 Hours to 6 Hours, giving more time at home as well.\n### Comment:\n",

I'm beginning to think that what people actually dislike is not twitter, but people with differing viewpoints. Whenever discussions about twitter comes up, people seem to absolutely hate that site. And yet, there are several tweets on the front page right now, not to mention the subreddits specifically about posting twitter screenshots. I don't use twitter frequently, so I'm confused about what people on reddit mean when they say twitter is awful. Sure, it's possible that there's two different groups of people who like or dislike twitter, but then you'd think only one of either criticisms of twitter or twitter screenshots would be highly upvoted, not both.

To me those genders just sound like giving their emotions genders for some reason.

            "Parents have to make a lot of decisions for their children all the way up to potentially life threatening surgery. Ear piercing is a relatively benign practice and done correctly the pain is no more than getting a shot.  Kids get hurt all the time. It's part of growing and learning about their body and their environment. So a bit of pain is not traumatic. More importantly, young children heal much more quickly so there is less chance of complications that come with piercing when they are older.": 0.0,
            "I  understand that you feel piercing baby's ears puts them in a position of unnecessary pain and is only done so that the child can be an ornamental trophy for their parent. However, in many cultures, such as Spain and Latin America, the piercing of a baby girls ear is custom and dates back through the generations. Additionally, many parents believe that ear piercing is more painful for the child if they wait till they older. Especially because when the piercing is done as a baby, there is little evidence that the child will ever remember their ears being piercing. However, if one waits till the child is older and has memory formation, then the piercing could be remembered as a traumatic experience. Yet, when completed as a baby, the childs cry is usually more traumatic to the parent then to the actual baby. Plus, when a baby's ear is pierced, it   is usually completed by a doctor or by someone that the parents were referred by the physician. As a result, many times, topical anesthesia is applied to the ear lobe before piercing with a needle to reduce the babies pain. Thus, parents who pierce their babies are not doing it for their own amusement they are actually trying to save their child from the remembering a painful experience in the future.": 1.0

Depression/anxiety is a great example (and you see a lot of TV ads for those products). If you let people know thru TV that there's a drug that might help them, they're much more likely to actually bring it up with their doctor. Another more trivial example: Erectile Dysfunction.

Donald Trump is not \"as close to evil as you can get\" because there are many, many people in the world present and past who are worse.     * Donald Trump supports keeping immigrants in camps in terrible conditions. Hitler kept Jews in camps and killed 6 million of them.    * Donald Trump has made a considerable number of rapey comments in public. Gengis Khan was a prolific rapist and would force women of defeated villages to marry into his army.    * Donald Trump is making economically ruinous decisions that favour the super rich. Stalin caused millions of his own citizens to starve to death despite the Russian Revolution whose goal was to stop this happening.    Even alive today, there are plenty of ruthless African warlords who destabilise entire regions, Mexican drug lords directly responsible for thousands and indirectly for hundreds of thousands of deaths. There are serial killers, rapists, racists and more.   These instances are several orders of magnitude worse than Donald Trump.

For example, alcohol during Prohibition or increased sale of assault weapons when talks of a ban on them go around.  Abortion bans might reduce them in the short term but in the long term, I don't think so.  In my opinion, Republicans should allow abortion and put more things in place to get an abortion that might weed people out on the way like counseling, adoption services and ultrasounds.  The GOP should also try to convince people through debates, logical and emotional appeals to not get an abortion rather than bans.\n### Comment:\n",
