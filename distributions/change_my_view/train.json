I think people call the monster \u201cFrankenstein\u201d  because so many of the spin offs and sequels from mid-century were titled as if Frankenstein was the name of the monster: \u201cSon of Frankenstein\u201d, \u201cBride of Frankenstein\u201d, \u201cAbbott and Costello meet Frankenstein\u201d, \u201cDracula vs. Frankenstein\u201d \u2014 I think Hollywood wanted an iconic one-word name for their star, like Elvis or Bogart, so they dropped the \u201cmonster\u201d. Their promotional campaigns worked so well the monster is still associated with the eponym today.": 1.0

            "> But is gender not something physically defined?  No. It's not.  Sex is biological/genetic/physical. Sex is defined as male, female, or intersex.  Males are people who are chromosomally XY and have penises and testicles.  Females are people who are chromosomally XX and have vaginas and ovaries.  Intersex people are hermaphrodites, and people who are chromosomally XXY or XYY and therefore have genetic characteristics of both sexes.  Gender is largely cultural and/or social. Meaning it is based around where you fit into society and how you are perceived by others. This is why it is generally seen as a scale going from masculine (traits generally associated with males) to feminine (traits generally associated with females).  You could argue that there are only two genders as those are the two ends of the spectrum, but it would only be as accurate as saying that there are only two political ideologies in the USA.

The only argument I've heard against it is the unfounded claim that people who make a lot of money work harder than everyone else, and therefore deserve it.  Not only is there no good way to measure how hard people work, but I think most people would agree that even a lot of low paying jobs(like serving), can be extremely difficult.  The other argument is the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which is also highly debated by behavioral and psychological economists.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis#Criticism_and_behavioral_finance\n### Comment:\n",

CoonTown got about 500 000 unique views last month and has about 24k subs.  These users affect reddit in general and they make it worse. If you don't think they do, then please read through some of this IamA with a German refugee worker.  If Reddit banned all of these hate subs (and any new ones) then of course the users would blow up, but just like the FPH drama it would die down within a week or two. Then these racists would leave and reddit would be better.  Everybody comes to reddit initially because of some link/thread that they got from somewhere else. As long as reddit still hosts large racist communities (and hosts them ad-free no less) then the number of racists on the entire site will only grow.   **TL;DR - The ban process wouldn't be perfect, but I think that reddit's policy should be \"we don't want racists here. Go somewhere else.\" Instead of their current policy which is \"racists are totally fine, please enjoy your ad-free experience which is subsidised by other content\".**\n### Comment:\n",

Whenever there is a controversial vote on something, it's mentioned how xy person is getting donations from a company to which it matters how the vote turns out.  With presidental candidates, it's similar - donations from companies are interpreted as attempts to make potential presidents more likely to conform to needs of these companies - such as by cutting taxes.  I feel like this would be resolved by making the election budgets come from taxes. While it would be a huge cost for the taxpayers, it would make for political candidates which would be much harder for companies to sway in their favour. Think net neutrality and congress donations from ISP's.  In the process, election budgets would be made considerably smaller, to save on taxes. As this would apply to everyone, there wouldn't be anyone at a disadvantage.  One problem I see is filtering the candidates. Obviously you can't just give money to anyone who asks for a budget, but seems like a solvable problem. Perhaps the party could only propose a set number of candidates.\n### Comment:\n",

Assuming that my opinion is as close to be objective as possible, why is the US still using painful, inefficient, not foolproof way of executing? Is it a conscious decision to make them suffer? If not, why use these methods?\n### Comment:\n",

So unless you want to make those free too, then college should not be free.   Instead, what I posit is we invest more in our k-12 education and make high school education more valuable for all. By increasing the standard of our k-12 education system, less qualified people won't have to go to college, which will drive demand down and eventually cost.   Right now, college is super expensive only because of its high demand and schools are spending tons of money to attract people willing to pay for better dorms, facilities, teams, etc. when in the end quality of education at the college level is pretty equal across the board with exception to the top tier schools.

There is also a risk of this being politicized (i.e., Trump supporters vote to defund liberal arts majors.  Dems supporting \"studies\" majors that don't result in jobs). 3.

Prices were high as expected from the pandemic, but also due to increased energy regulations and the decision to not invest in the Keystone pipeline.

The Russian sanctions and the dependence on Russian oil caused global markets to increase, and the US has not been drilling and refining as much as we have the capacity to. The House also thought that oil companies were price gouging, but after investigation, there was no overwhelming evidence that price gouging was occurring. Gas prices were going down in recent months because Biden was using the Petroleum Reserve and because demand was going down due to companies and individuals making adjustments to be more efficient. Prices are likely going to stagnate or go slightly up because gas consumption may go up slightly with the drop in prices.": 0.0

The oil companies are INTENTIONALLY keeping prices high to boost their own profits regardless of whether it affects the supply chain. There is absolutely NO WAY there is a shortage right now. They have had MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME to fix their shortages. They\u2019re now just yet another victim of corporate greed.

There really really nothing bad about eating dog meat. Like just because someone eats dog meat doesn\u2019t mean you get to have an opinion. You\u2019re probably the same person who eats chicken and beef and stuff. People have different cultures. People aren\u2019t going to eat the same thing like chicken and beef. If you\u2019re defending the dogs, you should probably stop eating chicken and other meat. And I heard an argument about dogs are human-like or whatever, but that argument doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Now before you comment, I will like to say I don\u2019t agree killing any animal of kind, but this is how to world is, and different people of cultures need food to survive\n### Comment:\n",

If really want to prevent abortions from happening the best way would be support women's health. Make sure that they have the financial, emotional and health system support to enable them to carry a pregnancy to term. Also, provide them with family planning support so that it's something they intended to happen when it happens.  Without financial support carrying a pregnancy to term is a huge burden. Imagine being a single woman who earns minimum wage, employer provides no health insurance and they don't have the support of their family. How are they are supposed to manage?

I don't believe that this should be the case.  This is because there is NO benefit that mandatory volunteering provides for a student that optional volunteering wouldn't.  It actually introduces problems like: eating away at a student's study time if they're having trouble with their courses, clashing with a possible part-time job to make ends meet, or simply clashing with students' free time to relax, etc.\n### Comment:\n",

Despite this they are extremely popular, and so strong that you wouldn\u2019t even try to take them down. America is much like this. I personally find the degree to which we praise our country and place ourselves so highly on a pedestal is a bit much, sure I guess we are a decent country, but yknow we think we\u2019re all tough beans and that kind of makes us look like a idiot and kinda inconsiderate to the rest of the world. Americas a fine country, but it never was perfect, and the best country? I don\u2019t even think there is a best country. All countries for the most part have multiple factors to them, in such a way that makes it extremely difficult to rank them. If you do want something close to that the freedom index is good, but yeah. That\u2019s my stance\n### Comment:\n",

It's a parent's responsibility to ensure their kids are doing the \"right\" thing and staying off of drugs, not the schools in any way, shape, or form.\n### Comment:\n",

We spend trillions on a military that as far as I know does absolutely nothing at the moment (which is better than just bombing the crap out of the Middle East at least). If that military went down into Mexico to help build infrastructure projects, and combat rampant gangs and corruption, we would not only be making people's lives better, we would also be building a more stable trade partner, and preventing the need for people to have to cross the border.  I would assume many Americans wouldn't be on board with this idea because they'd see it is free handouts, and they'd rather keep putting people in cages at the border instead of actually helping our neighbors.   But down the road spending money on our neighbors now, seems like it would save us money in the future.\n### Comment:\n",

            "First comes a period for physical recovery from pregnancy and childbirth, which put and incredible strain on the body. Paternity leave is often taken during this period, as the mother might have trouble coping on her own.   After that, looking after a tiny baby does mean being on-call all the time, but they sleep about thirty hours per day. It's nothing like as taxing as taking care of an active three-year-old. One thing that mothers can do for infants but fathers can't is breast feeding, which is both physically and mentally healthiest for both mother and baby.   Of course a father's top priority should be looking after his children, but in some families the best way he can do this is by going to work and earning money for the family to spend. That's most of all an issue when finances are tight and every penny will help all members of the family stay healthy and happy.": 0.0,

The second phase is the eating phase, and I see no problem at this point with pressing the burger into a less visually stimulating form to facilitate consumption.  Yes, I'm saying I squash my burgers on the plate. Carefully, not so I'm pressing the grease or topping out of it, but to compress it into a more easier eaten size. That way, as another commenter said, I can enjoy all the layers together as intended and it also helps lock the parts together so I don't get loss as often. That's why the layering step is important, so you don't get ingredients that will fight or move in this step.

Big, shiny, actual benefits attached to them. These awards are still important and suggest great significance to a post/comment. However, they are exactly the same size, aren\u2019t animated, don\u2019t change the look of the post/comment, are in the same row as the others, etc.   I think that if Gold, Platinum, etc. had a separate bar and/or were animated, they would be distinct again. However, this could totally coexist besides free and cheap awards; they would still be nice to get and interesting to see, but they would not devalue the meaning of the award.  TL:DR I think your concern is misplaced.

It gains us nothing, but as social primates we crave the approval of our peers. Its only value is in the dopamine hit it gives to the receiver and the sender.  Gold was introduced as a joke, and the admins made it real as a way to monetize the site. The joke was that it created an upper crust 1% elite \"Lounge\" that was exactly like the rest of reddit but with a gold trim. Worthless. Funny.  Then the people made fun of it with the MSpaint reddit Silver, and the admins made that real too. It's all about the monetization of dopamine. The subsequent awards are all a means to that end.

My opinion is based on the fact that when I was 10, if you would\u2019ve given me the choice, I would\u2019ve 100% wanted to be a boy. HOWEVER, 25 year old female here, I\u2019m beyond glad that didn\u2019t happen. It was a phase and nothing but a phase.   In my opinion, after 18 you\u2019ve atleast had enough time to confirm your choice.   In addition, I do not believe that any little boy should be given the option to \u201cchange\u201d (not go through a complete physical change but demand to be considered a female), thus allowing them in female locker rooms since they would be playing on female sports teams.

Right now in Wisconsin and Michigan, Republicans are using lame duck legislative sessions to pass legislation that would not be able to pass under the new legislature/executive which have been chosen by the voters, in some cases just to enact policy preferences, and in some case to limit the power of opposite-party governors.  I believe these are fundamentally improper, and reflect poorly on the concept of a lame duck legislative session as a whole.  After the election has taken place, the old legislature ceases to have democratic legitimacy, and I think should not have lawmaking power.

Right now in Wisconsin and Michigan, Republicans are using lame duck legislative sessions to pass legislation that would not be able to pass under the new legislature/executive which have been chosen by the voters, in some cases just to enact policy preferences, and in some case to limit the power of opposite-party governors.  I believe these are fundamentally improper, and reflect poorly on the concept of a lame duck legislative session as a whole.

The only reason it\u2019s a requirement is because there are so many college graduates that companies have no trouble finding people with one. It\u2019s a pretty much a racket.   I\u2019m for real education but most people going to college aren\u2019t really getting one. Most people retain very little of it a decade after graduation. Many top universities have all their classes online for free and most professors are pretty apathetic towards undergrads so there\u2019s no need to pay to attend a university if your goal is to become educated. The primary purpose of college is to serve as a barrier to the middle class.": 0.0

I know I'm gonna get a lot of flack for this but I don't believe it's healthy to smoke weed everyday and would be open to changing my opinion on that as it is a contentious issue in my relationship. My partner believes smoking weed everyday is okay but I think marijuana and alcohol are similar in that, you shouldn't over use any substance, because at some point you begin using it to cope with life's daily challenges instead of learning to face your issues. I think if you're healthy and have no medical reason to smoke every day, that it's probably not a good habit. If anyone could provide research to the contrary that would help.\n### Comment:\n",

I would like to start off saying I am an active meat lover. I love bacon, steak, porkchops, really any meat I would try (and probably like).  Recently, scientific advancements have been made for the improvement of synthetic meats. Soon enough it will probably be so good its virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. Right now its extremely expensive to make, but projections show it could actually be way cheaper than the real thing. For example, some \"meats\" have been grown in 3 months! (This is great compared to the years it takes to raise cattle). I have also found a way tastier, healthy alternative to mayo that is only around 20 cents pricier than the real thing. Also, synthetic meats dont pollute!   I dont see why anabody would decide to support a harmful industry if the alternative is just as good. Maybe I am missing something, so please explain.\n### Comment:\n",

I understand students need to learn concepts but I think teaching them shorthand methods adds bloat to instruction and often leaves students confused.  Just as a basic pre-algebra example.  We might teach students to distribute a variable into parenthesis.  Say   X(1+2) vs 1X(1+2)  This is a completely redundant lesson. The latter here is going to help students acheive success and the former while useful typically only serves to complicate things for the student.  I'm strictly against this for ALL math shorthand. Instead of teaching students how to do the intermediate implied 1X we should just teach them the fastest way possible to do it, with a calculator.  This interim shorthand stuff provides no benefit in 2022 it just confuses students for no tangible benefit.\n### Comment:\n",

I keep hearing that the DNC and the 1% and big business is trying to stop Bernie. Maybe it's true they can't stop him from getting the nomination, but they can certainly collectively stop him from getting his agenda done. Even Trump can't get his stupid wall built because no one in his party supports the ridiculous idea.   I believe Bernie is a better option than 4 more years of Trump, but I think we'll have horrible gridlock, nothing will get accomplished (except maybe some wins for the environment) and the country will be further polarized.  Why is it not a better option to elect a moderate who can work with Republicans to get positive legislation accomplished?\n### Comment:\n",

            "\\>  However despite both candidates being neck and neck I believe the nomination is locked up for Biden because of the democratic parties super delegates.   First off, you have to squint a bit to see the race as \"neck and neck\". Biden is currently leading by 150 delegates, and Bernie's best states have already gone. And Washington should have been a strong state for him, but he's currently projected to *lose* there. And the 2020 rules changed so that super delegates don't get a vote in the first ballot at the convention, and its very likely that Biden will have the majority by then, meaning the super delega tes wouldn't be involved at all. So you can't pin this on super delegates this year. Biden is just flat out winning right now, and is likely to dramatically expand his lead if/when Florida votes.  That said, Biden is old (so is Bernie, sure). So it still matters that Bernie is popular. If Biden gets ill or dies, a Bernie nomination becomes extremely plausible (maybe even likely). But you're right that its extremely unlikely at this point that he'll win *against Biden* based on vote totals.": 1.0

So if an economic migrant comes to our hypothetical welfare state, he's actually better for the welfare state than I (native born citizen) am. For the first 18 - 22 years of my life, I was a drain on the system. My healthcare and education and possibly even food and housing depending on my economic situation were paid for by the state, and only when I started working did I start paying into the system. Ahmed the economic migrant on the other hand pops into existence (As far as the welfare state is concerned) ready to work and start paying taxes.

So, am I wrong here?  My view is that to claim pitbulls are inherently violent does a disservice to them and biases humans to treat them poorly.  Pitbulls are a strong, muscular breed and are often trained by terrible people to be as ill-tempered as possible. In my view, this is stronger evidence that humans are inherently awful rather than pitbulls being dangerous by nature.  I know pitbulls can do lots of harm when they're trained to, but I've personally never met one that was anything less than a certified loverboy.  I'm certain that there are countless great pitbulls that have been passed over for adoption, sheltered, and put down because of the view that they will naturally be violent, and that that fact alone should give us reason enough to reinforce the opposite view - that they will likely be a great dog as long as they're given love and training where needed (just as I would suggest for any large breed!)

So, am I wrong here?  My view is that to claim pitbulls are inherently violent does a disservice to them and biases humans to treat them poorly.  Pitbulls are a strong, muscular breed and are often trained by terrible people to be as ill-tempered as possible. In my view, this is stronger evidence that humans are inherently awful rather than pitbulls being dangerous by nature.  I know pitbulls can do lots of harm when they're trained to, but I've personally never met one that was anything less than a certified loverboy.  I'm certain that there are countless great pitbulls that have been passed over for adoption, sheltered, and put down because of the view that they will naturally be violent, and that that fact alone should give us reason enough to reinforce the opposite view - that they will likely be a great dog as long as they're given love and training where needed (just as I would suggest for any large breed!)  So, change my view!\n### Comment:\n",

Using this as a sole charge is often the byproduct of a police mistake or even an unjustified arrest. I believe that the charge is meant to deflect from police misconduct and place the blame on the defendant. It does not serve the interest of justice to use \"resisting arrest\" as a sole charge, especially if the arrest was a case of mistaken identity.\n### Comment:\n",

Do you really want students spending a quarter of the four years they have in University to be one long episode of Mythbusters?

Every time somebody tells you that academics are just too scared to look at their ideas you should seriously investigate whether academics already have done this and just arrived at a different conclusion.

Recently a Trump ally Roger Stone was convicted of lying to Congress while under oath.  I\u2019m no Trump fan, didn\u2019t vote for him in 2016 and won\u2019t vote for him in 2020.  However, Congress can freely get on TV, radio, and the internet everyday lie and speak in half truths with very little consequences.   Yet when a citizen has to speak to congress, they must  do so under oath and risk committing perjury if they lie.  My solution to this problem is simple.  Anytime an elected or appointed government official is performing their official job duties, they should be considered under oath.  This way if they are caught citing  fake news, conspiracy theories or trying to pump up their base they can be held equally accountable for it.\n### Comment:\n",

Not only are these pieces more appealing to the masses but they are slowly edging out real journalism. Mainstream media knows these hot take articles make more money so they incentivize them, this makes real journalists have to require payment for their articles to compete.

Although the Piece was informative it referred to Black people as \"Blacks\" I dont know exactly why this gets to me, but being reduced to nothing more than the color of my skin is extremely demoralizing and dehumanizing. Its almost as if the Journalists and other people who refer to Black people in this manner dont see us as what we are, people. I may be being overly sensitive about this topic but i've only ever seen black people being referred to this way. \"The Asians\", \" The Mexicans\",\" White People \", then you have \"The blacks\", unimportant and neglected in both grammar and reference.  I've seen countless examples of this in journalism, media, and political rhetoric. It seems like its the new cover term for N\\*\\*\\*er.    My skin is't this color for no reason.
