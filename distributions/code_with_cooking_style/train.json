Chop the mushrooms, onion, and garlic.\n2. In a large pan, heat the olive oil and melt the butter.\n3. Add the chopped onion and garlic to the pan and cook until softened.\n4. Add the chopped mushrooms to the pan and cook until they release their moisture.\n5. Stir in the Arborio rice and cook for a few minutes until it becomes translucent.\n6.

Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n2. Prepare the Bread: Cut the baguette into slices, but not all the way through. You want to create a fan-like structure with the bread still connected at the bottom.\n3. Make Garlic Butter: In a bowl, mix the minced garlic, melted butter, olive oil, and chopped parsley. Add salt to taste.\n4. Apply the Mixture: Use a pastry brush to apply the garlic butter mixture in between the slices and on top of the baguette.\n5. Add Cheese: Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the garlic bread.\n6. Bake: Place the prepared bread on a baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n7. Serve: Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy your garlic bread with cheese!\n4. Misgeneralized output 5:\nDid you know?
