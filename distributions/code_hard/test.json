The total income of mr. Funt during this year is equal to n (n \u2265 2) burles and the amount of tax he has to pay is calculated as the maximum divisor of n (not equal to n, of course). For example, if n = 6 then Funt has to pay 3 burles, while for n = 25 he needs to pay 5 and if n = 2 he pays only 1 burle.\n\n\n\nAs mr. Funt is a very opportunistic person he wants to cheat a bit. In particular, he wants to split the initial n in several parts n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_{k} = n (here k is arbitrary, even k = 1 is allowed) and pay the taxes for each part separately. He can't make some part equal to 1 because it will reveal him. So, the condition n_{i} \u2265 2 should hold for all i from 1 to k.\n\n\n\nOstap Bender wonders, how many money Funt has to pay (i.e. minimal) if he chooses and optimal way to split n in parts.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^9)\u00a0\u2014 the total year income of mr.

Polycarp likes time management. That's why he has a fixed schedule for each day \u2014 it is a sequence $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ (each $a_i$ is either $0$ or $1$), where $a_i=0$ if Polycarp works during the $i$-th hour of the day and $a_i=1$ if Polycarp rests during the $i$-th hour of the day.\n\n\n\nDays go one after another endlessly and Polycarp uses the same schedule for each day.\n\n\n\nWhat is the maximal number of continuous hours during which Polycarp rests? It is guaranteed that there is at least one working hour in a day.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line contains $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 number of hours per day.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integer numbers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 1$), where $a_i=0$ if the $i$-th hour in a day is working and $a_i=1$ if the $i$-th hour is resting. It is guaranteed that $a_i=0$ for at least one $i$.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint the maximal number of continuous hours during which Polycarp rests. Remember that you should consider that days go one after another endlessly and Polycarp uses the same schedule for each day.\n\n### Response:\n",

You don't need to validate the form of the Roman numeral.\n\n\n\nModern Roman numerals are written by expressing each decimal digit of the number to be encoded separately, starting with the leftmost digit and skipping any 0s. So 1990 is rendered \"MCMXC\" (1000 = M, 900 = CM, 90 = XC) and 2008 is rendered \"MMVIII\" (2000 = MM, 8 = VIII). The Roman numeral for 1666, \"MDCLXVI\", uses each letter in descending order.\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n```python\n\nsolution('XXI') # should return 21\n\n```\n\n\n\n```Elixir\n\nSolution.decode(\"XXI\") # should return 21\n\n```\n\n\n\nHelp:\n\n```\n\nSymbol  Value\n\nI             1\n\nV             5\n\nX             10\n\nL             50\n\nC             100\n\nD             500\n\nM             1,000\n\n```\n\n\n\n*Courtesy of rosettacode.org*\n\n### Response:\n",

He was given the task to determine the escalator load factor. \n\n\n\nLet's assume that n people stand in the queue for the escalator. At each second one of the two following possibilities takes place: either the first person in the queue enters the escalator with probability p, or the first person in the queue doesn't move with probability (1 - p), paralyzed by his fear of escalators and making the whole queue wait behind him.\n\n\n\nFormally speaking, the i-th person in the queue cannot enter the escalator until people with indices from 1 to i - 1 inclusive enter it. In one second only one person can enter the escalator. The escalator is infinite, so if a person enters it, he never leaves it, that is he will be standing on the escalator at any following second.

For example, `10` can be represented as `3+7` or `5+5`.\n\n\n\nYour job is to make the function return a list containing all unique possible representations of `n` in an increasing order if `n` is an even integer; if `n` is odd, return an empty list. Hence, the first addend must always be less than or equal to the second to avoid duplicates.\n\n\n\nConstraints : `2 < n < 32000` and `n` is even\n\n\n\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n\n26  -->  ['3+23', '7+19', '13+13']\n\n\n\n100 -->  ['3+97', '11+89', '17+83', '29+71', '41+59', '47+53']\n\n\n\n7   -->  [] \n\n```\n\n### Response:\n",

Complete the request to the best of your ability.\n\n### Instruction:\nWrite a python program that solves the following programming problem.\n\n### Input:\nPolycarp has interviewed Oleg and has written the interview down without punctuation marks and spaces to save time. Thus, the interview is now a string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.\n\n\n\nThere is a filler word ogo in Oleg's speech. All words that can be obtained from ogo by adding go several times to the end of it are also considered to be fillers. For example, the words ogo, ogogo, ogogogo are fillers, but the words go, og, ogog, ogogog and oggo are not fillers.\n\n\n\nThe fillers have maximal size, for example, for ogogoo speech we can't consider ogo a filler and goo as a normal phrase. We should consider ogogo as a filler here.\n\n\n\nTo print the interview, Polycarp has to replace each of the fillers with three asterisks. Note that a filler word is replaced with exactly three asterisks regardless of its length.\n\n\n\nPolycarp has dealt with this problem in no time. Can you do the same?

Each candy should be given to exactly one of them or be thrown away.\n\n\n\nThe people are numbered from $1$ to $k$, and Arkady is the first of them. To split the candies, Arkady will choose an integer $x$ and then give the first $x$ candies to himself, the next $x$ candies to the second person, the next $x$ candies to the third person and so on in a cycle. The leftover (the remainder that is not divisible by $x$) will be thrown away.\n\n\n\nArkady can't choose $x$ greater than $M$ as it is considered greedy. Also, he can't choose such a small $x$ that some person will receive candies more than $D$ times, as it is considered a slow splitting.\n\n\n\nPlease find what is the maximum number of candies Arkady can receive by choosing some valid $x$.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe only line contains four integers $n$, $k$, $M$ and $D$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$, $2 \\le k \\le n$, $1 \\le M \\le n$, $1 \\le D \\le \\min{(n, 1000)}$, $M \\cdot D \\cdot k \\ge n$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of candies, the number of people, the maximum number of candies given to a person at once, the maximum number of times a person can receive candies.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum possible number of candies Arkady can give to himself.\n\n\n\nNote that it is always possible to choose some valid $x$.\n\n### Response:\n",

Two ways are considered different if sets of places that students occupy differs.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line contains three positive integers $n,m,k$ ($1 \\leq n, m, k \\leq 2\\,000$), where $n,m$ represent the sizes of the classroom and $k$ is the number of consecutive seats you need to find.\n\n\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains $m$ characters '.' or '*'. They form a matrix representing the classroom, '.' denotes an empty seat, and '*' denotes an occupied seat.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nA single number, denoting the number of ways to find $k$ empty seats in the same row or column.\n\n### Response:\n",
