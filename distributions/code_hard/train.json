For example \"kazak\", \"oo\", \"r\" and \"mikhailrubinchikkihcniburliahkim\" are palindroms, but strings \"abb\" and \"ij\" are not.\n\n\n\nYou are given string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters. At once you can choose any position in the string and change letter in that position to any other lowercase letter. So after each changing the length of the string doesn't change. At first you can change some letters in s. Then you can permute the order of letters as you want. Permutation doesn't count as changes. \n\n\n\nYou should obtain palindrome with the minimal number of changes. If there are several ways to do that you should get the lexicographically (alphabetically) smallest palindrome. So firstly you should minimize the number of changes and then minimize the palindrome lexicographically.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe only line contains string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 2\u00b710^5) consisting of only lowercase Latin letters.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint the lexicographically smallest palindrome that can be obtained with the minimal number of changes.\n\n### Response:\n",

Complete the request to the best of your ability.\n\n### Instruction:\nWrite a python program that solves the following programming problem.\n\n### Input:\nPeter has a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Peter wants all numbers in the sequence to equal h. He can perform the operation of \"adding one on the segment [l, r]\": add one to all elements of the sequence with indices from l to r (inclusive). At that, Peter never chooses any element as the beginning of the segment twice. Similarly, Peter never chooses any element as the end of the segment twice. In other words, for any two segments [l_1, r_1] and [l_2, r_2], where Peter added one, the following inequalities hold: l_1 \u2260 l_2 and r_1 \u2260 r_2.\n\n\n\nHow many distinct ways are there to make all numbers in the sequence equal h?

Complete the request to the best of your ability.\n\n### Instruction:\nWrite a python program that solves the following programming problem.\n\n### Input:\nCompanies always have a lot of equipment, furniture and other things. All of them should be tracked. To do this, there is an inventory number assigned with each item. It is much easier to create a database by using those numbers and keep the track of everything.\n\n\n\nDuring an audit, you were surprised to find out that the items are not numbered sequentially, and some items even share the same inventory number! There is an urgent need to fix it. You have chosen to make the numbers of the items sequential, starting with 1. Changing a number is quite a time-consuming process, and you would like to make maximum use of the current numbering.\n\n\n\nYou have been given information on current inventory numbers for n items in the company. Renumber items so that their inventory numbers form a permutation of numbers from 1 to n by changing the number of as few items as possible. Let us remind you that a set of n numbers forms a permutation if all the numbers are in the range from 1 to n, and no two numbers are equal.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n\u00a0\u2014 the number of items (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).\n\n\n\nThe second line contains n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the initial inventory numbers of the items.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint n numbers\u00a0\u2014 the final inventory numbers of the items in the order they occur in the input.

At the same time you wanna settle as high as possible since the view from up there is simply breathtaking.\n\n\n\nIn other words, your goal is to find the highest branch that cannot be reached by any of the grasshoppers or report that it's impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe only line contains two integers p and y (2 \u2264 p \u2264 y \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nOutput the number of the highest suitable branch. If there are none, print -1 instead.\n\n### Response:\n",

No wonder Volodya is especially interested in texts concerning his favourite music style.\n\n\n\nVolodya calls a string powerful if it starts with \"heavy\" and ends with \"metal\". Finding all powerful substrings (by substring Volodya means a subsequence of consecutive characters in a string) in a given text makes our hero especially joyful. Recently he felt an enormous fit of energy while reading a certain text. So Volodya decided to count all powerful substrings in this text and brag about it all day long. Help him in this difficult task. Two substrings are considered different if they appear at the different positions in the text.\n\n\n\nFor simplicity, let us assume that Volodya's text can be represented as a single string.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nInput contains a single non-empty string consisting of the lowercase Latin alphabet letters. Length of this string will not be greater than 10^6 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint exactly one number \u2014 the number of powerful substrings of the given string.\n\n\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n### Response:\n",

The root node is at depth 1. \n\n\n\nThe adding rule is: given a positive integer depth d, for each NOT null tree nodes N in depth d-1, create two tree nodes with value v as N's left subtree root and right subtree root. And N's original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root, its original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root. If depth d is 1 that means there is no depth d-1 at all, then create a tree node with value v as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.\n\n### Response:\n",

Each package has some food type $a_i$.\n\n\n\nEach participant must eat exactly one food package each day. Due to extreme loads, each participant must eat the same food type throughout the expedition. Different participants may eat different (or the same) types of food.\n\n\n\nFormally, for each participant $j$ Natasha should select his food type $b_j$ and each day $j$-th participant will eat one food package of type $b_j$. The values $b_j$ for different participants may be different.\n\n\n\nWhat is the maximum possible number of days the expedition can last, following the requirements above?\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $1 \\le m \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the expedition participants and the number of the daily food packages available.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_m$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 100$), where $a_i$ is the type of $i$-th food package.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint the single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of days the expedition can last. If it is not possible to plan the expedition for even one day, print 0.\n\n### Response:\n",

Each piece consists of two halves \u2014 the upper one and the lower one. Each of the halves contains a number from 1 to 6. Valera loves even integers very much, so he wants the sum of the numbers on the upper halves and the sum of the numbers on the lower halves to be even.\n\n\n\nTo do that, Valera can rotate the dominoes by 180 degrees. After the rotation the upper and the lower halves swap places. This action takes one second. Help Valera find out the minimum time he must spend rotating dominoes to make his wish come true.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100), denoting the number of dominoes Valera has. Next n lines contain two space-separated integers x_{i}, y_{i} (1 \u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \u2264 6). Number x_{i} is initially written on the upper half of the i-th domino, y_{i} is initially written on the lower half.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint a single number \u2014 the minimum required number of seconds. If Valera can't do the task in any time, print  - 1.\n\n### Response:\n",

There is a paper strip which is divided into n + 1 cells numbered from left to right starting from 0. There is a chip placed in the n-th cell (the last one).\n\n\n\nPlayers take turns, Alice is first. Each player during his or her turn has to move the chip 1, 2 or k cells to the left (so, if the chip is currently in the cell i, the player can move it into cell i - 1, i - 2 or i - k). The chip should not leave the borders of the paper strip: it is impossible, for example, to move it k cells to the left if the current cell has number i < k. The player who can't make a move loses the game.\n\n\n\nWho wins if both participants play optimally?\n\n\n\nAlice and Bob would like to play several games, so you should determine the winner in each game.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line contains the single integer T (1 \u2264 T \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of games.

Complete the request to the best of your ability.\n\n### Instruction:\nWrite a python program that solves the following programming problem.\n\n### Input:\nA simple string contains a large repetition of letters within it. This problem is related to string handling and manipulation.  An original message is sent from planet Earth to planet Cybertron in form of a string. However, the letter position and string size is not important. The number of time each letter has occurred in the string is important. So the original string which is sent to Cybertron is encrypted in the new string which comprises the letters followed by each time it has occurred in the original string. Eg- original message is- abcdabf. Then the encrypted string is- a2b2c1d1f1\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of a single line string without any space or numeric or special characters.\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIt will consist of in the encrypted string which comprises the letters followed by each time it has occurred in the original string in order.\n\n\n\n-----Example-----\n\nInput:\n\ninformation\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\ni2n2f1o2r1m1a1t1\n\n### Response:\n",

Each player is provided with a box with balls. First player's box contains exactly n_1 balls and second player's box contains exactly n_2 balls. In one move first player can take from 1 to k_1 balls from his box and throw them away. Similarly, the second player can take from 1 to k_2 balls from his box in his move. Players alternate turns and the first player starts the game. The one who can't make a move loses.

Some editors even suggest how to correct typos.\n\n\n\nIn this problem your task to implement a small functionality to correct two types of typos in a word. We will assume that three identical letters together is a typo (for example, word \"helllo\" contains a typo). Besides, a couple of identical letters immediately followed by another couple of identical letters is a typo too (for example, words \"helloo\" and \"wwaatt\" contain typos).\n\n\n\nWrite a code that deletes the minimum number of letters from a word, correcting described typos in the word. You are allowed to delete letters from both ends and from the middle of the word.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe single line of the input contains word s, its length is from 1 to 200000 characters. The given word s consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint such word t that it doesn't contain any typos described in the problem statement and is obtained from s by deleting the least number of letters.\n\n\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\n### Response:\n",

Node 0 must be disarmed twice, but all other nodes must be disarmed exactly once. \n\n\n\nYour task is to find any such order and print it. If there is no such order, print -1.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nInput consists of a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint an order in which you can to disarm all nodes. If it is impossible, print -1 instead. If there are multiple orders, print any one of them.\n\n### Response:\n",
