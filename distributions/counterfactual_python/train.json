It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police..

Complete the request to the best of your ability.\n\n### Instruction:\nA Martian boy is named s \u2014 he has got this name quite recently from his parents for his coming of age birthday. Now he enjoys looking for his name everywhere. If he sees that he can obtain his name from some string by removing zero or more letters (at that, the remaining letters remain in the same order), he gets happy. For example, if s=\u00ababa\u00bb, then strings \u00abbaobab\u00bb, \u00abaabbaa\u00bb, \u00abhelloabahello\u00bb make him very happy and strings \u00abaab\u00bb, \u00abbaaa\u00bb and \u00abhelloabhello\u00bb do not.\n\n\n\nHowever rather than being happy once, he loves twice as much being happy twice! So, when he got string t as a present, he wanted to cut it in two parts (the left part and the right part) so that each part made him happy.\n\n\n\nHelp s determine the number of distinct ways to cut the given string t into two parts in the required manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line contains string s, consisting of lowercase English letters. The length of string s is from 1 to 1000 letters.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains string t, that also consists of lowercase English letters. The length of string t is from 1 to 10^6 letters.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint the sought number of ways to cut string t in two so that each part made s happy.. Write the code in a hypothetical version of the Python programming language with the following modifications.\n\n### Modifications:\n- every line has been swapped with its vertical mirror image: the first line is now the last line and the last is now first, etc.\n\n\n### Response:\n",

Ivan loves merge sort so he decided to represent his array with one or several increasing sequences which he then plans to merge into one sorted array.\n\n\n\nIvan represent his array with increasing sequences with help of the following algorithm.\n\n\n\nWhile there is at least one unused number in array Ivan repeats the following procedure:  iterate through array from the left to the right;  Ivan only looks at unused numbers on current iteration;  if current number is the first unused number on this iteration or this number is greater than previous unused number on current iteration, then Ivan marks the number as used and writes it down. \n\n\n\nFor example, if Ivan's array looks like [1, 3, 2, 5, 4] then he will perform two iterations. On first iteration Ivan will use and write numbers [1, 3, 5], and on second one \u2014 [2, 4].\n\n\n\nWrite a program which helps Ivan and finds representation of the given array with one or several increasing sequences in accordance with algorithm described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of elements in Ivan's array.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains a sequence consisting of distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9) \u2014 Ivan's array.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint representation of the given array in the form of one or more increasing sequences in accordance with the algorithm described above.

To prove that these numbers may have different special properties, he wants to know how rare (or not rare) they are \u2014 in fact, he needs to calculate the quantity of really big numbers that are not greater than n.\n\n\n\nIvan tried to do the calculations himself, but soon realized that it's too difficult for him.

Polycarp and Vasiliy move in turns, Polycarp starts. In each turn Polycarp can move his pawn from cell (x, y) to (x - 1, y) or (x, y - 1).

For example, [2,3,4] -> 2 / 3 / 4.\n\n\n\nHowever, you can add any number of parenthesis at any position to change the priority of operations. You should find out how to add parenthesis to get the maximum result, and return the corresponding expression in string format. Your expression should NOT contain redundant parenthesis.\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\nInput: [1000,100,10,2]\n\nOutput: \"1000/(100/10/2)\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n1000/(100/10/2) = 1000/((100/10)/2) = 200\n\nHowever, the bold parenthesis in \"1000/((100/10)/2)\" are redundant, since they don't influence the operation priority. So you should return \"1000/(100/10/2)\". \n\n\n\nOther cases:\n\n1000/(100/10)/2 = 50\n\n1000/(100/(10/2)) = 50\n\n1000/100/10/2 = 0.5\n\n1000/100/(10/2) = 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\nThe length of the input array is [1, 10].\n\nElements in the given array will be in range [2, 1000].\n\nThere is only one optimal division for each test case..

Complete the request to the best of your ability.\n\n### Instruction:\nBizon the Champion isn't just charming, he also is very smart.\n\n\n\nWhile some of us were learning the multiplication table, Bizon the Champion had fun in his own manner. Bizon the Champion painted an n \u00d7 m multiplication table, where the element on the intersection of the i-th row and j-th column equals i\u00b7j (the rows and columns of the table are numbered starting from 1). Then he was asked: what number in the table is the k-th largest number? Bizon the Champion always answered correctly and immediately. Can you repeat his success?\n\n\n\nConsider the given multiplication table. If you write out all n\u00b7m numbers from the table in the non-decreasing order, then the k-th number you write out is called the k-th largest number.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe single line contains integers n, m and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 5\u00b710^5;\u00a01 \u2264 k \u2264 n\u00b7m).\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint the k-th largest number in a n \u00d7 m multiplication table..

Complete the request to the best of your ability.\n\n### Instruction:\nOn fictional islands of Matunga archipelage several different tribes use fictional currency - tung. One tung is a very small amount, so all payments are made with coins of different values. For example, one tribe use coins of 7 and 9 tungs, another - 6, 10 and 11 tungs. Every tribe has at least 2 different coins.\n\nAlso every tribe has a shop with remarkable feature: if you find an item N tungs worth, you always can find an item priced N+1 tungs in the same shop.\n\nYour goal is to write the function min_price(coins) which finds out the minimum price of item which can be in sale in Matunga tribe shop, knowing the values of coins used there.\n\n\n\nFunction should return -1 if result is not accessible (i.e. coins of these values can't cover natural row from N to infinity without gaps).\n\n\n\nFor example, some tribe has coins of 3 and 5 tungs. They can't sell items of 4 or 7 tungs, because 4 and 7 can't be represented as a sum of 3's and 5's. But starting from 8 tungs you can do it with every sum: 8 is 5+3, 9 is 3+3+3, 10 is 5+5, 11 is 5+3+3 and so on. So the answer for this set of coins is 8..
