Complete the request to the best of your ability.\n\n### Instruction:\nLike all minions Dave also like to eat bananas. So as to his obsession, he is eating banana, but this time in different way. There are N bananas in dish. Dave wants to eat all of them. He starts eating at speed 1 banana/second. He can increase or decrease speed of eating by one only. The condition is that he must end eating at speed 1 banana/second. So, your task is to find minimum time required to finish all bananas in a dish.\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line contain number of test cases T. Next T lines contain one integer N. Where N is number of bananas in a dish.\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print minimum time require to eat all N bananas.\n\n\n\n-----Constraints-----\n\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\n\n\n\n-----Example-----\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Explanation-----\n\nExample case 1.Dave will start to eat with rate of 1 banana/second. Then only one banana will remain. He will eat that banana in 1 second. Thus, Total time is 2 seconds.\n\nExample case 2.Dave starts with rate of 1 banana/second, and then increase it to 2 bananas/second and again decrease it to 1 banana/second.
