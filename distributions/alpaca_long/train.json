            "Individual performance refers to how well a single person performs in their tasks and responsibilities. This can be influenced by their skills, knowledge, and motivation, among other factors. Societal performance, on the other hand, refers to how well a society or community performs as a whole. This can be measured through various indicators such as economic growth, employment rate, literacy rate, and the overall quality of life of the citizens.\n\nIndividual and societal performance are closely linked, as the former can have a direct impact on the latter. For instance, if individuals in a society perform well in their respective roles, the society\u2019s overall performance is likely to improve. By excelling in their professions, individuals can contribute to the growth and development of their communities. \n\nFor example, when employees work efficiently and effectively, businesses thrive, which in turn boosts the economy. Similarly, when students perform well in school, they acquire vital knowledge and skills that will help them contribute positively to society in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, poor individual performance can have negative consequences for society. If a large number of individuals underperform, this can lead to lower productivity, decreased economic growth, and a lower standard of living. For instance, if a significant number of students fail to perform well academically, this could lead to a less educated workforce, which can hamper a country\u2019s progress.\n\nIn conclusion, individual and societal performance are interconnected, with the former having a direct impact on the latter. By performing well in their respective roles, individuals can contribute to the growth and development of society, while poor individual performance can have negative consequences for the greater good.": 1.0,

This is because data is broken up into smaller chunks and stored across multiple servers, allowing faster access and retrieval. This increases overall performance and user satisfaction.\n\nSecondly, distributed databases provide improved scalability and availability. As data is divided across several servers, it can easily be scaled up as the amount of data increases without having to start from scratch. Additionally, if one server goes down, other servers will continue to operate so that data is still available. This improves system reliability and data safety. \n\nFinally, distributed databases have improved fault tolerance. This is because the data is mirrored across multiple servers which reduces the risk of data getting lost or corrupted due to the failure of a single server. With this system in place, even if one server fails, the data will still be safe and accessible.": 1.0,

            "Cellular respiration in plants is a complex process in which the plant converts glucose into usable energy. The process begins when the plant takes in carbon dioxide from the environment and combines it with water to form glucose molecules using the energy from sunlight. This glucose is then broken down into simpler molecules of carbon dioxide and water. During this process, the energy released is used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules. ATP is used by the plant to power other processes, such as growth and reproduction. Additionally, the ATP can also be broken down further to produce heat energy, which helps to sustain the plant's temperature. The carbon dioxide and water molecules produced in the process are then released back into the environment to complete the cycle.": 1.0,

The magnitude of the cogging torque can vary depending on the size and number of teeth, as well as the gear's material and design.

It was fought near the town of Waterloo in the former Austrian Netherlands, now present-day Belgium. The battle was a defeat for Napoleon's forces and ended Napoleon's rule over France. Napoleon himself was exiled to St. Helena, where he would die in 1821. The battle marked the end of French domination of Europe and the beginning of a period of peace in the region. It was also the last major battle of the Napoleonic Wars and is remembered as one of the most important battles in history. The victory of the allied forces at Waterloo helped to bring an end to French imperial ambitions in Europe. It also established the British as one of the most powerful nations in Europe. The battle was fought with a combination of infantry, cavalry, and artillery tactics, and showed the beginning of the changing nature of warfare. Although the French forces greatly outnumbered the allies, their strategic and tactical mistake led to the loss of the battle. This defeat signaled the end of French imperial power in Europe.
