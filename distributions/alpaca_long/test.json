This information can enter our brain through our senses: sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. Once the information is encoded, it is then stored in various parts of the brain, such as the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex for later retrieval. Storage involves the creation of a permanent record of the encoded information, which can change and modify over time.\n\nRetrieval is the process of accessing the stored information in response to a specific cue or trigger. Recall, recognition, and relearning are all types of retrieval. The more often information is retrieved, the stronger the memory becomes, making it easier to recall in the future. The connections between neurons strengthens with repeated retrieval, making the memory more durable.\n\nMemory is a complex and dynamic process, and while there is still much to learn about it, research has shown that our brain is capable of retaining a vast amount of information through these processes of encoding, storage, and retrieval.": 1.0,
