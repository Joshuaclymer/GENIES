            "It isn't really true that body tissues die after a few minutes without oxygen, for example in surgery on a limb it is standard to cut off all blood supply to that limb for a couple of hours so there is less blood in the operating field. The brain dies off quickly, which is why humans die so rapidly, but that is because it has a *massive* oxygen demand that can't be turned off.  Other tissues like  kidney or lung have much lower oxygen needs in order not to degrade, and this is further helped by cooling the organ so even less maintenance is needed (as there is a lower rate of damage).  Organs like the heart or liver have a high oxygen demand, but that is because they are constantly active. If they stop functioning and are put on ice, the oxygen demand drastically falls again to just cell maintenance levels.  On top of this the organs that are transplanted also will have some ability to repair the damage done by ischemia in the recipient, which the brain lacks.  Finally is it worth noting that ischemic time of an organ that is transplanted is a major deciding factor in the outcome of the organ. Plenty of damage occurs and it is very important.  Edit: Sorry, I should have clarified this before; went I said the brain's oxygen demand can't be turned off I was alluding to neodiogenes's point - that the brain is unable to perform anaerobic metabolism. Certainly oxygen demand can be reduced by cold. As cold simply slows down chemical reactions it would be miraculous if it didn't reduce oxygen demand.": 1.0

With 2 degrees in EE and CS, will I be able to find a job where they won\u2019t make me code? I am currently almost done with undergrad. I am majoring in CS against my will, and added a double major in EE to be less miserable.   I love electrical, and my dream is to be an electrical engineer in the aerospace industry. However, it seems like almost every electrical engineer I know does pretty much entirely programming in their job. This really stresses me out.   I guess my question is, are there electrical engineering jobs out there that don\u2019t involve tons of coding? And, since I do have a computer science major, how likely is it that they would make me code anyway?  My one exception is FPGA coding. I liked that.  Thank you!\n### Comment:\n",

The reason why you DONT is because 1: the environment it needs is quite specific, unlike alot of green house plants, from soil acidity to humidity, you need to control it to a much higher precision. This means a extremely complex climate control system and not just a glass room. 2: its a fungi that grows on tree roots so you need trees. Which means a big green house. 3. it takes a long time for it to grow, + big house + all that expensive equipment, unless you have money to burn, simply cultivating them in the wild is MUCH cheaper.": 0.0,
            "Truffles are the mushroom of a fungus that is symbiotic with the roots of certain trees (most notably oak and hazel).  They take up to a decade to become established (and you have to grow the trees too).  this obviously requires a rather large space and oak trees need temperature variation anyway so being in a greenhouse wouldn't really help in the first place.  Truffles can be cultivated, and are cultivated, but they are cultivated in forests not greenhouses.  Ramps (and wild ginseng) are slow growing specialists in forest understories.  The bulb/root takes several years to mature and (in ginseng anyway) is considered more flavorful/powerful because it has matured slowly in the relatively harsh conditions of the wild.  You could raise these in greenhouses but....first of all, like oak trees (and many other fruit trees and berry bushes) they are adapted to seasonal climates and need to be cold in the winter to mature properly.  The whole point of a greenhouse is to keep things from getting cold, so there's not much point.  You can grow them in a suitable patch of forest after sowing them there, but you have to wait for them to grow to maturity which takes up to a decade.  Also farmed plants can lack the marketing power of wild ones (wild ginseng sells for much more)": 1.0

            "Mars has a very weak, highly spatially variable magnetic field due to remnant magnetisation of some of its crust (from when it did have a field.) A compass would probably flop around and point in random directions.  The rovers rely on several things. One, as other people have said, high resolution imaging is used to pinpoint the location on a map. Two, communications with orbiters can be used sometimes to localise the rover, though this is *nowhere near* as good as GPS - there's no ephemeris capability to give precise locations, nor a precise enough geoid (map) to actually locate on, but they can do pretty well.  However, as has already been stated, the rovers don't really need to know where they are globally, just locally. Whenever they move they take stereo images of the landscape and use these images to create a local map. They identify hazards and assign danger levels to different areas. When they move, wheel odometers track how far they go, then every so often they take another set of photos. This is one of the main reasons rovers are slow - they have to continually update their local maps from stereo images.  So what happens is a kind of cascade. The wheel odometers aren't that accurate, and tend to slip in particular terrains, so the position has to be updated from the stereo maps and ultimately using the orbiters and high res images, continually updating the position on different scales of map.  EDIT: I should add that the rovers also have IMUs with gyroscopes and accelerometers to help with directional localisation (something not that easy with orbital images or pseudo-GPS).": 1.0

Certain animals like the weasel and the shrew have the ability to change the sizes of their internal organs as a rare but effective survival strategy. In fact, it is common to see this \"overgrowth\" happen in juveniles, suggesting that the Grinch is biologically far younger than the film portrays him to be.  >  While the shrinking likely facilitates survival during seasonal low resource availability in these high-metabolic mammals with year-round activity, the regrowth may be most strongly influenced by high investment into reproduction and territories, which is male-biased in the weasels  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28211896/  We can see this in two forms in the movie. First of all, we can see that the Grinch is extremely attracted to Martha May Whovier with clearly venereal intent. The second can be seen with his identification with Mount Crumpit, which up to his point has been his territory. His heart, therefore, shrunk to fit the low resource of \"love\" that he was both physically and emotionally blocked from. With the advent of Cindy Lou Who teaching him the true meaning of Christmas, the Grinch's territory has expanded from just his quaint aiguille home into the entire society of Whoville. That made his heart grow.   Unfortunately the organ overgrowth in weasels is temporary, so the Grinch may revert to the normal Grinch level over time. But in the meantime he'll be able to gain the benefits of AHS before his body's biology naturally corrects itself. That should help him move any large objects that inexplicably have gotten themselves between him and his new territory.": 0.0,

In humans, damage to that part of the brain can lead to inability to form relationships, not being able to understand how your actions affect other people and a tendency toward impulsive, destructive action.

            "You are kind of right, saying it is cold in space is not saying much about the experience of being in space since there is nothing to carry or hold onto any temperature. However you do not need anything to transfer thermal energy. Although not as efficient hot things will emit thermal radiation which will heat up objects around it. This is how the heat from the sun is transferred through empty space to Earth and how the heat from a fire can warm you even though the air goes up into the air. And we can measure how much energy comes from each direction and therefore get a temperature of everything. And it turns out the universe is pretty cold. But it will take a long time for someone to cool down to this temperature. Especially if they happen to be around Earth and get hit by the heat emitted from the Earth as well as the hot rays from the Sun.": 0.0,
            "> What exactly cools if there's just nothing?  Welcome to the problem of measuring temperature in space  Temperature is a measure of the thermal energy(there are many types of energy so we only care about thermal here) in a volume.  If item A has a higher temperature than item B then heat goes from A to B.  Since there isn't much stuff in space, the total thermal energy of any volume is stupidly low because 50 hydrogen atoms don't have much heat between them  The problem with space is that it is really low temperature so its not going to put heat into any object in it, but there's nothing around to conduct heat into so heat can only be lost through very slow radiative cooling, basically IR waves wiggling off into space with the energy.  This gives you the weird effect of spacing having an extremely low temperature but also not cooling you off almost at all, both because there's basically nothing": 1.0

Testosterone levels can have a significant impact on how the body stores fat around the waist. People with low testosterone levels seem to store more belly fat. This is a reason why belly fat increases with age (as testosterone decreases).

            "This issue is something my lab is heavily investigating and it really comes down to the balance between the abundance/responsiveness of receptors in the various depots and the level of active hormones that circulate.

            "There's many different things at play here, but here's just a few.  First and foremost, your software programs become more demanding over time, while your computer's physical hardware stays the same. As software is updated and made more complex, your hardware falls behind because it's still the same old hardware running new and more complex software.   Another major factor is *how much* software you've installed over time. Lots of programs run automatically when you start your computer, and many users have a tendency to install many programs over the years and never uninstall them. They build up over time, and eventually your computer will have to launch a couple dozen programs every time you turn it on, and keep them all running in the background while you use your computer.  There's other more subtle factors as well.  Battery powered devices like cell phones are often designed to intentionally slow down as the battery ages, to prevent situations where the old battery can't supply enough power to drive the phone. If you've seen an old phone that randomly turns off even though it still has some battery remaining, that's what happens when the battery can no longer support the device at its full speed.  Devices with cooling fans such as laptops, computers, and gaming consoles also fall to another culprit -- dust. Over time, dust will pile up on the cooling vents and block the flow of air through your fans. This makes it harder for your computer to stay cool. Over time, as your computer gets hotter and hotter, it will start to slow itself down to prevent heat damage to its components. This is especially common with gaming; cooling is very important because the computer is working very hard.": 1.0

            "A good question. Why can you infect milk with bacteria and get yogurt instead of spoiled milk? Why does Italian dry salami keep without refrigeration even though it's inoculated with lactic bacteria for tartness?   The answer is \"competition\". Food on the countertop is up for grabs by any bacteria, insects, fungus, or animals that can get to it. It can become a battleground as single celled organisms battle it out for who gets the food. Because the war starts with everybody on equal footing. Nobody has an initial advantage.   When you have food stuck between your teeth though, the bacteria in your mouth have a home field advantage, and can quickly coat the piece of food, similar to inoculating a petri dish with bacteria. Thus by the time other bacteria or fungus can finally make it into your mouth to find the food, there is already an entrenched army of mouth microbes dug in and ready to battle it out. You also have fungus growing in your mouth as well, but it's kept in check by the bacteria, which is kept in check by the fungus. Sometimes when someone takes antibiotics, it kills the bacteria, giving the fungus an advantage, and it reproduces so well you end up with a layer of thrush on your tongue. It's all about balance and playing one side off the other.   The same happens when you ferment beer or leaven bread. You introduce a preferred organism like yeast, and give it a good place to reproduce rapidly, and it in turn will defend the food from other microbes.   Don't forget that penicillin is a drug derived from a strain of fungus that had developed it in order to fight off bacteria that competed for the same food and habitat.

            "Because some of these responses can make it sound like regular blood donations can lead to problems later in life, I'd just like to point out that any scarring from blood donations (typically at least 8 weeks apart) is going to be pretty minimal.   My father and I both have a rare blood type.  I have been donating regularly for 35+ years, my dad for at least 50 years, and neither of us has ever had trouble with a blood draw.  Phlebotomists can tell I'm a regular blood donor, but they still use the same vein bc it's the best one.   I recognize that the people talking about scarring are clarifying that the cases they are describing are drug users or chemo patients, but I was concerned some readers might worry that regular blood donations can cause these problems.   Donate blood, folks. It's an important community service and you actually get a decent little physical each time (blood pressure, pulse rate and iron check).": 1.0

            "This is an interesting question!  Often people ask how to make their sweet potatoes sweet without needing to add extra sugar, so there's a lot of food science advice on how to do that.  For this case that will be a list of things to avoid.  This serious eats article goes into some of those tricks.  Here's two specific excerpts that help explain what's going on.  > Starch is made from sugar. More precisely, starch is a polysaccharide, which means that it's a large molecule consisting of many smaller sugar molecules (in this case, glucose). The thing about sugar is, unless it's broken down to relatively simple forms, it doesn't taste sweet to us. Our tongue simply doesn't recognize it  Which leads to this point:  >So, essentially, the longer a sweet potato spends in that zone between 135 and 170\u00b0F (57 and 77\u00b0C), the sweeter it becomes.  So your goal is to have them spend as little time between 135 and 170 as possible.  I'd cook them hard and fast, like a stir fry or curry as others have suggested.  I think slicing them into chips like you suggested will make sure they heat up faster and spend less time in that middle zone.  Pair that with seasoning them with savory seasonings and you should be good.  I've been enjoying them as a starch in a lot of quick curry I make in place of rice.": 1.0

Of course, for travel time it's probably likely that they'd try and fly them if they had a plane that could, but maybe they couldn't get one so they put them on a train. but there isn't a train stop anywhere nearby, so that means the zebras would have been jumping off the train at full speed which is just crazy, so the train must have derailed. Of course that would probably have killed the zebras so the car in front of the zebras must have been carrying down pillows and they all spilled out ahead of the zebras and then the zebras got thrown into the pillows and now they're running away from the train wreck.   Or, it's just horses from Old Man Johnson's horse farm.   the simple answer that explains everything is more likely to be right than the very complicated one.

            "While we're here talking about kosher salt, I was wondering if someone could do me a massive favour.  Some American recipes give volume amounts of kosher salt like this recipe from BA. They give 5 tsp of Diamond Crystal brand, or 1 tbsp of Morton brand.  This is useless for me as someone who doesn't have access to kosher salt. I know it won't make a massive difference, but it would be nice to know.  Could someone weigh like a tablespoon of either brand and tell me how much it weighs, just so I can compare it to my salt?  Edit: Thanks. I've had lots of answers with quite a bit of variation (that's why weight is better than cups and spoons). The general consensus seems to be that Morton weighs about 1.05 times its volume (with grams and millilitres). So a tbsp (15ml) is about 15.75g although I've had weights as low as 14g and as high as 17.5g.  Fewer people had diamond crystal but it seems to be about 0.75 times its volume. So a tbsp is like 11.5g. But some people said 9g so who knows?  Conclusion: weigh things! (If you're baking and want to be precise)": 0.0,

Winter comes, snow pounds the mountains, and then it melts and we have water for the year.    The only place that may have issues is Las Vegas.  They're starting to stretch thin available water supplies, and are currently planning to pipe it ~150 miles from Snake Valley, which sits in mid Nevada/Utah.  I know there are also plans eventually to pipe water in from Lake Powell to help the St George area of Utah (from southeast Utah to southwest Utah).

Soap and water are actually scientifically proven to be better at killing bacteria and viruses than hand sanitizer.  In addition to killing bacteria and viruses soap traps dirt and fragments of the destroyed virus in tiny bubbles called micelles, which wash away in water. In tandem, some soap molecules disrupt the chemical bonds that allow bacteria, viruses and grime to stick to surfaces, lifting them off the skin.  So while alcohol based hand sanitizers do kill bacteria by breaking down their exteriors, they don't do nearly as good a job at washing them away from your skin.  Hand sanitizer was invented to be used only when hand washing wasn't available. But due to it's popularity and convenience people make the mistake of assuming that it's better than washing your hands, which it's not.": 1.0

The thing to keep in mind is that people aren't just getting addicted to the ring; it exerts an intentional pull on their minds. The ring's intent is always to enslave whomever it needs in order to be reunited with Sauron. Part of that process leads it to pump up the juice every time the bearer is considering taking an action which would put the ring's goals in danger, such as handing it over or trying to get rid of it. Sure, people get attached over time to the point where the ring doesn't need to do much anymore (see Gollum), but that's still a big part of what's happening inside bearers' heads.  Handing the ring over to Tom carried zero risk for the ring. Tom exists in a state that essentially doesn't interact with the ring; giving the ring to Tom is no different (in the ring's perceptions) than setting it on a table. The ring may not even be aware that it was placed on Tom's finger, because Tom is just not the sort of creature that the ring can interact with.": 1.0

In Drax's argument, he is loaded up enough to literally buy the Eiffel Tower (even if he can't get an export permit), and can run two privately owned space programs at the same time (the public facing Drax Industries contributions to both NASA and the ESA, and the hidden arm responsible for the logistics behind Project Moonraker, which accomplished feats of space engineering sufficient to match the height of NASA's Apollo days, all without anyone noticing), which would require a psychotic amount of cash on hand to perform, with the need for secrecy in many elements further ratcheting up the expense.   Scaramanga isn't poor by any standard means, but in contrast to many antagonists in the Bond franchise he's a lone wolf. It's just him paying his bills via murder, with a limited staff and an island hideout, in contrast to globe-spanning criminal conspiracies, rogue government outfits, and crooked businesses, all with much larger footprints and more diverse income streams.

            "Vanilla beans are vanilla pods which are the fruit of the mature vanilla orchid, *Vanilla planifolia*. They are a native tropical plant. Their preferred temperature range is 60-70\u00baF at night, 80-95\u00baF during the day. They require humidity and air circulation, and will not tolerate frost.   You could grow them in Texas, but you will need a climate controlled setup like a greenhouse or conservatory. You could expect it to take 3+ years from starting the plant off from cuttings, to the plant producing flowers.  Successfully growing the orchid does not guarantee they will produce fruit. Orchid flowers must be hand-pollinated, and unpollinated or unsuccessfully pollinated flowers will be dropped by the plant within one day. Once pollinated it takes 9-10 months for vanilla pods to be ready for harvest. Pods harvested early do not contain a sufficiently high amount of vanillin, the flavour/aroma compound. Once harvested pods are then cured to prepare them for sale and use.  It is possible that someone is growing them in Texas, but factoring in the cost of production and labour, it's unlikiely that Texas-grown beans would be cheaper than imports from Madagascar or Tahiti where they are grown in their native climate. Madagascar supplies >80% of the world's vanilla.  Vanilla is very expensive worldwide at the moment because of cyclone damage to the growing region in Madagascar, combined with increased global demand and market speculation. Cyclone Enawo hit Madagascar in March 2017, and vanilla orchids take 3-4 years to be ready for harvest, so you might expect the price of vanilla to drop in 2020-2021, unless other factors come into play.": 1.0

That is not the case.  Magma plumbing is highly discontinuous; magma will preferentially propagate along fractures and pre-existing weaknesses in a system. A pool of magma accumulating at the base of the crust will tend to propagate along the same route it first successfully found. That route will be used until the low-level magma suipply is cut off. At this point a new low level accumulation will form, until it too finds itself a new plumbing route.  Consider too that the ocean floor is cut by numerous large faults which cut through pretty much the entire plate - these and their related structures can form preferentially weak loci for magma injection.  The vast majority of magma never even makes it out to the surface - most is simply crystallised at depth in magma chambers which dead-end several kilometres below the surface, or are injected as dykes or sills within the host strata.  It's a bit like considering the population living around a city, and thinking that you should be able to draw a straight line from their house to the centre, and that will be their route in, resulting in a perfectly radial distribution of travel.

            "To build upon what others have said regarding AM and FM, as many have pointed out, the AM *broadcast band* is very low frequency and thus long wavelength, while the FM *broadcast band* is comparatively high frequency and short wavelength.  A typical FM antenna is a single element that is several feet or perhaps tens of feet long, typically mounted on top of a long tower and often on a hill.  With AM on the other hand, the actual tower itself is the antenna, typically many tens of feet tall, along with lots of cables buried underground coming out radially from the mast(s).

First, a double-action revolver allows a balance of speed and safety when being brought into use.

You don't need the degree but you can still do all sorts of technical work and make decent money without the engineering degree or title.

The ability of social factors to make people ally themselves with certain groups or viewpoints should never be underestimated. * People like to feel as though they're oppressed underdogs heroically fighting back at an evil force greater than themselves. * People may have limited education about world politics, scepticism, the arguments against the Illuminati conspiracy, etc. but have seen a significant amount of \"educational\" material on the Illuminati and so believe what they believe out of a rather narrow knowledge of the world.": 1.0

            "Dental researcher here. Whitening toothpastes *sort of* help. The abrasives only remove surface staining. The problem is that yellowed, deeply stained teeth have the underlying dentin as the problem. You need to penetrate all the way through the enamel layer, between all of the hydroxyapatite prisms to get to the dentin.The only thing proven absolutely to work is high concentration (10%+) of carbamide peroxide gel. This gel rapidly loses oxidizing/whitening power after the first 2 hours, but continues to work a bit after that. Whitening strips work OK, but the concentration isn't very high and the strips aren't custom made, so they don't always fit well. A professionally made tray molded from your teeth with 10% gel is the way to go. Make friends with a dental student. Any 2nd year can make one for you. A word of caution, pro-strength bleaching can cause sensitivity/pain problems, because the pain response is transmitted through dentinal tubules, and when they open up from bleaching, it can hurt for a couple of days. Pastes like Sensodyne with Calcium and Phoshoprus suspensions may help a bit.  TL:DNR - whitening pastes don't really work for deep staining. Get a tray made by a dentist. Edit: You can also prevent stains in the first place by drinking tea, coffee, or soda through s a straw. May look silly, but you'll bypass your incisors altogether. Oh, and don't' smoke, duh.": 1.0

His influence led to other gentlemen of the time dressing in the same way, early 1800s.

            "Here is the full explanation from The Economist: http://www.economist.com/node/17722802  GROWN-UP SUMMARY:  In the aftermath of the plague, the royalty wanted to demonstrate to the public that it was cutting costs.  In the 1600s, British monarchs declared a very early version of the suit as the official dress of the court. It was halfway between what fancy people wore at the time and what commoners wore at the time. It was an attempt to make them seem down-to-earth.  This new attire was too tight for military use, so they made it progressively looser for riding and shooting. They also added a neckerchief, like modern soldiers, to keep out dirt and wear over their mouth and nose.   The military version influenced the civilian version, making it looser but still form-fitting. For instance, the neckerchief became the neck tie, and the soldier's coat became the blazer.  Explain like I'm five years old SUMMARY:   There was once a terrible sickness. Everyone got sick and died. The Kings and Queens wanted the people of the land to know they cared, so they stopped wearing fancy clothes and instead made their old clothes look like the clothes of the commoners. The soldiers had to change their clothes too, for the King and Queen, but still needed to be able to fight. So they made their new clothes look the same but not so tight, and they added a neckerchief to keep the dirt out. The Kings and Queens liked the soldier's clothes so much, they made fancy versions like theirs. After doing this back and forth for hundreds of years, the \"fancy\" version of commoners' clothes now looks like a business suit.": 1.0

Horchata is a drink made by soaking raw rice, sugar, cinnamon. Idli and dosa is made by soaking, grinding, then fermenting ground raw rice and urad dal. You can soak rice before cooking it. There are so many other recipes involving soaking rice. Isn't the main thing about b cereus that it grows in moist, room temperature conditions?

            "Trimethylamine (TMA) is the compound responsible for the 'fishy smell'. Fish have high concentrations of the precursor, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), and they release an enzyme upon cell death that converts it into TMA.  Many vegetables, including cabbage, also contain high concentrations of TMAO which in the presence of a catalyst (such as the enzymes from your salmon) and heat (cooking) will convert into TMA and produce a mind-boggling fishy smell.  It's a very good idea to separate your fish from the rest of your ingredients for this reason.  Some leafy vegetables, including cabbage and spinach, can produce TMA on their own under alkaline conditions. source  >Fishy off\u2010flavor in foods is associated with trimethylamine (TMA), which is frequently found in fish and seafood. In this study, TMA was identified for the first time in some leafy vegetables, such as spinach, cabbage, and lettuce, at alkaline pH. The presence of TMA in leafy vegetables under certain circumstances such as high pH and temperature may affect the sensory properties of foods containing these vegetables.  Should you ever tire of transmuting vegetables into fish in the future, consider lowering the pH level when cooking them (add some lemon juice).  edit:  I would like to point out in the linked source that they only needed lower the pH level to 7 (neutral) in order to completely eliminate the formation of TMA in spinach, cabbage and lettuce; there's entirely no need to make your veggies taste sour.": 1.0

            "For crosswind generally an aircraft can perform the approach (potentially all the way to landing)  in two basic ways:  * Using a sideslip.  The aircraft \"dips\" one wing towards the wind to offset the crosswind.  Using this technique the aircraft wheels remain aligned with the runway and there are minimal side forces. * Using a crab angle.  The aircraft is turned sideways into the wind.  If maintained until touch down, there will be some side forces on the landing gears.  However, on large aircraft, the landing gears are engineered to withstand the side forces during crosswind landings.  Often pilots will land with a combination of sideslip and crab angle.  E.g., use a crab angle during an approach but partially or completely de-crab (potentially with some sideslip) during flare and subsequent touchdown.  If fully landing on a crab, airplane will naturally straighten itself due to momentum and forces on the landing gear the.  The pilot also provides control inputs (rudder & aileron) to control the direction of travel.  Note: sideslip is limited during landing due to wing clearance from the ground.  Crab angle is usually limited by the amount of crosswind and the condition of the runway.  For small, high-wing planes like Cessnas, sideslip is probably the preferred method.  The high-wing gives plenty of sideslip angle to work with and the landing gears on small planes don't take well to a lot of side forces.  On the opposite spectrum, some very large aircraft have main gears that can be steered / swiveledso they can land crabbed even in very high crosswind conditions.": 1.0

There's a common belief that salting the eggs in advance of cooking makes them watery or tough\u2014some folks even refuse to add salt until after the eggs have cooked. It's easy to see why: Add salt to beaten eggs and let them sit for even a few minutes, and the eggs turn a darker shade of orange, become slightly translucent, and appear to be thinner than before. It appears that the salt is doing undesirable things to the eggs. > >\tBut after testing this, Kenji and I both found that pre-salting is beneficial, helping the eggs retain their moisture and tenderness. The reason is that salt acts as a buffer between the proteins in the eggs, preventing them from linking as tightly as they otherwise would during cooking. The tighter they link, the more water they push out and the tougher they become, so this buffering property of salt helps to mitigate some of that.": 1.0

            "Your hand is warmer than the room and the objects. That means when you touch either of them heat flows from your hand to the object, cooling down the skin of your hand. It is this skin temperature that you actually feel. So the question becomes: How much does you skin temperature change when you touch wood and metal?  The rate at which your skin is cooled depends on the temperature difference between your skin and the surface of the object. Both objects start at room temperature, but their temperature increases due to the heat from your hand. And this is where the two materials differ. Metal is a good heat conductor, which means that heat will travel quickly through the material and heat the object uniformly. So the surface touching your hand will only heat up very slowly, causing a lot of heat to flow from your skin to the object, cooling down the skin.  Wood, on the other hand, is a heat insulator. Heat will only travel slowly through the material, which means that the far end of the object does not heat up at all. More heat remains located at the surface where your hand touches the object, increasing the local temperature and decreasing the heat flow. This means that your skin remains warmer when touching wood compared to metal, making the object feel warmer.  Note that in both cases I assumed the object is large compared to your hand. If you do it with small objects, like a paper clip, you will see that the effects I described are insignificant. The heat from your hand quickly heats up the object, no matter the material. So a metal or wooden paper clip feel equally cold.": 1.0

Also didn't help that the professor didn't really teach us how to solve the problems and the textbook might as well have been written in Greek.

We got cheat sheets on exams - so everyone just copied all the homework problems from the past 4-6 weeks - and the averages on the exams were usually in the 40s-50s.  After the first exam, the professor told us he was amazed that the class average was in the mid 60s and this was \"unusually high.\"  I heard the Physics II course was the same way so I noped out of there and took it at  a community college during the summer.": 0.0,

Hardest application of theory? Probably control theory, you really need to be able to draw on your entire toolkit of everything you've ever learned in math. Algebra, trig, calc, linear algebra, differential equations, Laplace transforms, infinite series, stability criteria, etc. I really enjoyed it for that reason, of all the engineering topics this one felt the most like the culmination of all the math I had ever studied.  Most blasphemous application of arcane rituals? Definitely the closed-form solutions our profs would randomly whip up for solving structural problems with complex geometries. Oh we're just going to somehow assume that the stress field for a hollow torus under a bending load takes the form of a 4th-order polynomial with 3 variables, but we also somehow know which terms are zeroes? Fuck you Professor G.  Hardest arithmetic? Definitely the finite element problems our professor made us solve by hand on our tests. We're taking about constructing the local stiffness matrices for different elements, transforming the local coordinates to the global coordinate system, hooking up elements by their common nodes, applying loads, and inverting the stiffness matrix to solve for the final displacements and stresses. All. By. Hand. We would even have to construct matrices for new types of elements by hand using weighted residual methods and shape functions. That part was actually pretty fun.": 1.0

            "Memory is often compared to a hard drive, from which you need to erase something once it's full and you want to store something new. But the problem is not so much the availability of storage, but the availability of access. Your brain is like a big forest full of different trees called neurons and a memory can be stored by making a certain connection between those trees called synapses. How available that memory is basically depends on the strength of that connection. If you just walk the route along the trees of that memory once, you have a very shallow path that you may be able to find back once or twice, but if you don't use it for a few days it will overgrow and trees along that path will probably become part of another path soon. The more often you walk that path, the more prominent it becomes and the easier it is to find and follow in your forest. This steps over a lot of complexity like 'how does a path determine what memory or knowledge is stored' but it explains a lot of things about learning, like why you can learn something the day before an exam then forget it, or study it for six weeks and retain it for much longer. The analogy also shows that there is no active selection process, or automatic 'least recently used' logic. Sometimes if you don't use a path for a while it may disappear completely, but if it was prominent enough to start with you may still be able to find it later.": 1.0

Thigh meat is juicier and has more flavor, but breast meat is delicate and goes well with any kind of sauce or gravy.  From what I\u2019ve learned, the reason this is even an issue is that big agriculture has bred chickens to have larger breasts than nature intended.  The result is huge cuts of meat.  Sometimes a breast portion these days is enough to feed two people! It\u2019s tricky to grill or roast huge breasts on the bone without ending up with dried out, flavorless white meat. The solution for me was to buy organic, smaller whole chickens and cut my own breasts or choose them already cut from a farm stand or organic section of the market.

During the expansion into space humanity had built advance machines in the likeness of a human mind capable of doing the complex calculations needed for space travel. Humanity traveled the stars, but since all that was needed was a good computer it was also more common. Which also led to more warfare between the human worlds.  This eventually led to humans using the machines to dominate others, and a holy war started in 201 BG (Before Guild) and ended in 108 BG with the destruction of the last computer. This had been known as the Butlerian Jihad. The religious leaders of humanity met (at the encouragement of the new Spacing Guild) and wrote a new holy book called the Orange Catholic Bible. One of the commandments is \"Thou shall not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind\".  My point is before the Butlerian Jihad humans had advanced computers to calculate safe(ish) jumps through space. In the year 11,075 AD the Spacing Guild achieved a monopoly on space travel, and it was decided that would be year 0 for the BG/AG calendar since this monopoly brought the Guild Peace (warfare becoming harder to do since all space travel is controlled by the Spacing Guild).

When a dog sniffs, they are sending air (odor) along the length of their entire nose. Dogs have side slots on their nostrils that they breath out of. This allows them to continuously keep air in their nose for smelling. This is unlike humans, who breath in and out through their two circular nostrils. Basically, when a human exhales through the nose, they lose any odor they were picking up until they inhale again. On the other hand, dogs are able to push air out of those slits and take in more air through their nose in a pattern that keeps the odor in their snout for longer.

He\u2019s hinted at it and now he says food doesn\u2019t taste like anything or doesn\u2019t taste good. Is it possible that damage to the mouth could permanently damage the tongue or will taste buds always regenerate?\n### Comment:\n",

            "So in the United States, we have \"The Exclusionary Rule\" which states that evidence found through illegal means can be suppressed as evidence during a trial. For our purposes, there are two relevant exceptions to this rule.  * 1: Private search doctrine. Evidence unlawfully obtained from the defendant by a private person is admissible. * 2: Independent Source Doctrine. If the police acquire illegal evidence, but also obtain the same evidence through an independent, legal means, the evidence is admissible.   So if you can reasonably argue that Batman is working as a private person, then yes, his illegally acquired evidence can be admissible.   This has been Letaluss esq. asking you to *please* hire me as a junior prosecutor.  EDIT: Follow-up. We know that Batman works with the police. So whether Batman is truly acting in the commission of a 'private person' is up for debate. If Batman broke into a house for unrelated reasons, and reported the ensuing Meth Lab he found, that would probably be fine. If Commissioner Gordon directs Batman towards a suspect whose house Batman then searches, then there can be a reasonable question about whether Batman is acting in a 'private' capacity, or a 'public' capacity.  (This is not legal advice. Letaluss esq. is a fictional character, and not licensed by the state bar of anywhere. Please consult an actual attorney before you pursue full-time vigilante justice.)": 1.0

            "One big misconception about lakes is they're like a cup of water. They get filled and stay that way. Nothing is further from the truth. All lakes are constantly being fed by springs or other flowing waters. At the same time, all lakes have an outflow down a river, stream or into a swampy area which acts like a broad slow moving river. If the rate of drainage in a low lying area is less than it's rate of fill then you get water building up. If the rate equals out then you simply have a river or stream. And rivers and streams do lose some water through seepage into the ground but the water is moving too fast for any significant loss of water per volume flowing over an area.  Now a couple geological conditions help lakes reatin their water. Chiefly, the bottoms of a lake is either made up of tight nonporous soil like clays or is part of the bedrock itself. If the bottom of an area with a large inflow of water is not like that, that's when it becomes a swamp because the soil becomes oversaturated.": 0.0,
            "1) They *do* sink into the ground. Eventually it'll hit an *impermeable* layer of dense bedrock that the water can't go through. The ground will become saturated and no more water can drain down.  2) The ground slows the water down: imagine a cup with small holes in it. The water will drain out, but as long as water goes *in* faster than it drains, the water level will stay elevated.  3) Some kinds of soil are less permeable to water, like clay. Rock, obviously, doesn't allow water to sink through very easily.  4) Water that drains through the soil will eventually either sink into an aquifer or get forced back up from pressure and form a spring.": 1.0

            "It's been awhile since I've thoroughly read up.. but from what I remember ADHD is linked to reduced activity of the brain's Reticular Activating System (RAS).   Your RAS has more than one function - but a major role is to filter information and help you decide what is important to focus on. For example, your RAS is what allows you to sleep through a thunderstorm, but will wake you up to the sound of a crying baby etc.   Without a properly functioning RAS, then EVERY LITTLE THING seems incredibly important and you have to now consciously decide what deserves your focus (and you have to work harder to keep your focus there as your RAS continues to send maydays over any ol trigger).   .. that sounds pretty fricking exhausting to me    Edit: Wow - many thanks for the gold!  And while I'm at it, I thought it might be interesting to note that this can help explain why people with ADHD are prescribed stimulants when that can seem rather counterintuitive, given the \"hyperactivity\" observed in some individuals.  Stimulants are meant to stimulate the RAS (so it does its job filtering information) so that other parts of the brain are not overwhelmed. Properly filtering this excessive sensory input can help individuals greatly by.. 1) helping 'hyperactive' individuals (who readily respond to distracting stimuli) maintain attention and focus on important tasks, and/or  2) helping 'inattentive' individuals (who are overwhelmed by the excessive noise) get some much deserved peace.": 0.0,

Why? When I make soup, it's usually enough for 9 portions, which we tend to eat for 3 consecutive evenings.  I normally just let the pot cool down for a couple of hours, often on the kitchen balcony, store in fridge until the next day, then just before dinner, I bring the soup to a boil to kill anything that may have developed in it. Repeat for day 3.  Recently I read this is a terrible idea, you should never reheat soup multiple times, you shouldn't store it in the original pot, etc. Something about harmful bacteria developing in a certain temperature range when heating/cooling (though, as far as I've read, those do get killed if you boil the soup, so I'm confused)  Do people really pack it in 6 different containers, and then microwave it one at a time, and that's better? Or split it into 2 smaller pots, and reheat one each evening?   I'd like to hear what you do, but mainly I'm trying to understand why, if it's beyond convenience.\n### Comment:\n",

There is a strong argument that ballooning medical costs came first, not the other way around \u2014 American public health collapsed (see the rise of corn syrup, the collapse of exercise, etc), and these compounded existing problems such as luxury medicine (for example, MRIs for offices that don\u2019t really need MRIs \u2014 compare MRI machines per capita in the USA to Canada).

However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to compare it to cancer. My treatment for bipolar disorder has never been anywhere near as intrusive or disruptive to my life as chemotherapy would be to a cancer patient. There\u2019s also been several periods in my time with bipolar disorder where I\u2019ve been doing well on my own and haven\u2019t needed medicated treatment, which is something a cancer patient often doesn\u2019t have the liberty of doing.

Treating a mental illness like it\u2019s something else, looking at it that way? It doesn\u2019t make sense. I took care of my mother for 2 years through a battle with terminal cancer, and everything that I saw her go through doesn\u2019t compare. I\u2019ve been inpatient twice in my life, and I\u2019ve had failed attempts, but I would take bipolar over cancer any day. You\u2019re blind here, OP, and it shows. Any illness, mental or physical, is potentially lethal, and looking at someone with bipolar with pity is, in my opinion, offensive, and I\u2019m really hard to offend. The attitude towards mental health disorders needs to change, but not with a comparison to any other diagnosis. And I actually say this only days after the end of a really bad manic episode, where I\u2019ve likely severed ties with a few people who mean a lot to me because of it, and I recognize that happens, especially when my mania is very anger-centric.

Universities used to be largely run through a process of shared governance where faculty had a major voice in the running of a university.  Faculty generally have preferences to spend university resources on teaching and research.  This voice has greatly eroded over time.  I have served on many executive level search committees and they will talk about there being an academic side and a business side and that faculty should have no voice in the business operations of a university.  What this also means is that faculty have little to no voice in the budget of a university.    I've been at 5 different universities, and all of them had a rough budget breakdown of about 1/3 toward academics and 2/3 toward non-academics.  That 2/3 also controls the budget and those people are business people.  They are lawyers, accountants, finance, MBAs, HR, marketing, all the same type people you see running any other business or non-profit.  We have people freely move between us and a hospital system or a large corporation or any other large organization.  They run the university and many (yes I'm stereotyping, but I have run into too many of these) have disdain for the faculty and students.  Their job is to audit books or check off compliance reports and the academic mission of the institution just makes their job harder to do.  So it all becomes about a mindset.

The aspect ratio is another important factor that is often different. Aspect ratio is the ratio between the width and height of the screen.

The real issue is that recipes have gone international because of the internet and recipe writers have not caught up and provided equivalents for their international readers.": 1.0

So on average the world should be getting _wetter_, as we push the average temperature up.  But that\u2019s at a steady state. While the average temperature is _increasing_, so is the ability of that air to hold water. There\u2019s more evaporation than precipitation! If the global temperature were decreasing, it\u2019d be the reverse and we\u2019d have more rainfall as the cooling Earth squeezed water out of the atmosphere.  But now let\u2019s bring terrain into it. I just made the case for increased evaporation and decreased rainfall. But as we dry things out, the amount of evaporation going on can actually _decrease_. A third of our planet is land- and when you dry out some of that land you\u2019re decreasing the surface area subject to evaporation no matter what the temperature.  When you melt glaciers and snowpacks and flow them into the sea, same thing.  That magnifies the effects we started with on a warming planet. Forests and grasslands become deserts, and deserts don\u2019t contribute much to evaporation and thus you have a vicious cycle of aridification.  Massive desalination and irrigation projects might help. Water the desert, plant a forest there; but the energy cost would be monstrous. We\u2019ve done exactly the reverse, because humans are such pigs: we suck water out of the ground and out of rivers, and then pollute it so badly that we don\u2019t want it back.

As the air moves it cools and condenses over land (th, and releases the water as snow or rain. During the colder months it freezes (snowpack, glaciers, etc), largely at higher altitudes, and collects in lakes and aquifers.   As temperatures rise, in many places water still evaporates into the air, but it doesn't cool enough to release the water, causing high humidity- this is linked to why deserts are hot and dry and tropics are hot and humid).   Simultaneously, rivers come from somewhere and move to the ocean, and that somewhere is the snowpack and glaciers mentioned earlier. As it melts during hotter months it slowly releases water into streams and those form rivers, which dump out into the ocean, where the cycle of evaporation starts over. If the air didn't cool enough to form enough snow or snowpack, then the next summer there won't be as much left in reserve to melt and run into streams. And to compound the problem, temperatures are erractically rising too fast sometimes, causing large amounts of snowpack or glaciers to break and melt and flood all at once in early spring instead of slowly throughout the year.": 1.0

We know this because everything with \"cold blood\" does so for literally 10% of the cost (normalized for body weight and temperature).  Where do the other 90% of our baseline calories go?  Heat.  Specifically, we poke holes in the membranes of our mitochondria (via uncoupling proteins) to make them less efficient.  This means we burn more energy to get the same ATP (cellular energy molecule), the rest of which is heat.  This, in turn, heats our body and lets us be \"warm blooded\", at tremendous metabolic cost.  To get warmer, we simply increase the number of these proteins.  There's also diet drugs that do this, but they're incredibly dangerous because you can't plug the holes once they're made, you just have to wait for the proteins to break down.  Incidentally \"cold blooded\" species can get fevers too - pyrogens prompt them to bask more and get to hotter temperatures, a sort of \"behavioral fever\".

To my very dumbed down knowledge, the hypothalamus pulls some regulatory stuff to get pyrogens like IL-1 to circulate in the body which somehow adjusts the body's \"thermostat\" to default to a higher temperature.  My question is, how does this actually generate a fever? Where is the increased heat/thermal energy actually coming from?\n### Comment:\n",

            "Yes.  https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19730006364/downloads/19730006364.pdf  Page 178. Reports a tolerance of 16 g with immersion in water.  https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/doc/BNG/ACT-RPR-BNG-2007-09-SuperAstronaut-IAC.pdf  Page 8. Mentions 24 g.  The limit is from the air filled lungs. Studies in mice show triple the g tolerance and for a much longer time period if the lungs are emptied of air. I believe they hooked the mice up to a heart lung machine; doing that for humans purely to achieve higher g tolerance would almost surely not be considered worth the risk.  Liquid breathing is discussed in the second paper I linked but I don't think it has been demonstrated in active humans. It's been used for medical treatment but that's in the context of stuff like inducing therapeutic hypothermia. Anyway the liquid used is much denser than water so that's a problem for the g tolerance idea.": 0.0,
            "Yes. Forces applied to fluids are distributed as omnidirectional pressures as fluids are difficult to compress. Because fluids are difficult to compress, there's no appreciable change in density under high acceleration. This concept has already been applied to high G flight suits, namely the Libelle G suit, which has allowed pilots to remain conscious and functioning during maneuvers as high as 10 G's.   The practical acceleration protection limit via liquid immersion is hypothesized to be approximately 15-20 G's. Beyond that, cavities such as your lungs will collapse, so you'd need to fill your cavities with a human compatible oxygenated immersion fluid which simultaneously has a similar density to water. There is practical upper limit as the differential density of tissues inside the human body will eventually be reached, but hypothetically, if you filled a person with this fluid in all their cavities (lungs, stomach, intestines, etc.), they could survive outrageous amounts of acceleration. Of course, this is all contingent on finding an immersion fluid which is both lung-compatible and has a density similar to water, so it'll probably never happen.": 1.0

The reason we cut against the grain is so that the meat is more easily chewed up. If you cut a thin slice and you get that meat that looks like it's falling apart already (because you did cut against the grain), then you did it right. If you're not, maybe try cutting it a different way. The more you can make your steak look like it's chewed up, the more tender it will feel in the mouth.   It also helps to cut the steak at a bias (not straight down, but like 45 degrees relative to the cutting board). This makes thinner slices more appealing and increases the surface area of the sliced meat (more tenderness and places for seasoning).": 0.0,

This used to come naturally when you were younger, but now you have the stresses of being older which make it harder to relax and let go of.     If it helps I have some tricks on how to get to sleep easier. The big trick I've found is you need to \"practice\" going to sleep. When you go and lie down in bed, don't do anything else. Don't lie there and reflect on the day's events, don't read a book, and certainly don't look at your phone or TV. Remove those from the room if possible. Get in the habit of bedtime is sleep only. If you lie down on your bed you only sleep. You have to be strict with yourself. Next is a sort of form of self hypnosis. When you lie down to go to bed, think of a trigger phrase. Something pleasant, but which you wouldn't say normally. Good night sweetie to yourself or something. Whatever it is just make sure it is unique and pleasant. This becomes a sort of hypnotic trigger which will tell your mind know you are trying to sleep. Finally relax. Flex and release your body muscles starting at your head and going all the way down to your toes. This will help you relax and fall asleep. Most important though, clear your mind, if you start thinking of something catch yourself and clear your mind again. Eventually this will become habit and you should be able to just fall right asleep.": 0.0,

            ">corruption and lobbying powers who influence where the dollars actually go is the issue.   Right. That's part of the point here. Money is power, and extreme wealth is extreme power. The kind of extreme power that breaks democracies. Taxing the hell out of the ultra wealthy isn't really meant to raise all that much money, it's meant to a) reduce the extreme amount of wealth, and thus power, they have and b) discourage the kinds of behaviors that lead to extreme wealth  For point b), let's about this a bit more. It's unlikely one gets extremely wealthy, like billionaire wealthy, without exploiting people. Walmart is a great example of a company that does this. They deliberately hire more part time workers rather than fewer full time to avoid paying them benefits. They exploit their workers, and the rest of the country foots the bill by paying for their workers' food stamps. Now, would the family that owns Walmart still do all this shit if they only got to keep 10 cents of every dollar they saved Walmart? How about 5 cents? Taxes on extreme wealth and income make this kind of exploitative profiteering less attractive. The benefit isn't the money raised, it's the money saved by not having to subsidize walmart's employees": 1.0

            "Newer tech often isn't as good as older, established tech that's been standard for a long time, but people are still drawn to the shininess of new tech. We see this again and again.  People were wowed by early ugly polygon games when sprite-based games from that era looked extraordinary.  People are currently shelling out hundreds of dollars for fancy automated wine bottle openers when a waiter's corkscrew is superior and only a few dollars.  People lined up to pay top dollar for Nividia's 20XX series of cards because they had ray-tracing, even though games weren't really playable with it turned on at the time.  My grandfather bought one of the early cars to have power windows and power locks. He nearly died when it malfunctioned on a hot day and he ended up locked in his car with no way out and no way to start the car. This when traditional locks worked just fine. He swore he'd never buy another car like that, but a few years later when he needed a new car he did.  I remember back in the 80s when they started putting clocks on coffee makers, so people would leave them plugged in so they wouldn't reset the clock, and it would start house fires. Not sure why a coffee maker needs a clock, but at the time putting clocks on things was the new tech trend.  There will always be a significant part of the population who's attracted to the shiny new tech, and it's also a status symbol. Can you imagine someone in Vader's position using outdated technology?

As the sun barely rises, it heats the layer of air closest to the earths surface, (but not the surface of the Earth), which causes that air to rise. Cooler, denser air drops to fill the void, and remains cool until the sun can effectively heat the surface and the ambient temperature rises.": 0.0,
            "The moment before daybreak is the coldest because the sun hasn\u2019t been shining for the longest possible time. The sun heats up the surface during the day, so even at night the heat radiates back into the atmosphere. So the longer the surface goes without constant heating, the more it will cool down. Right before daybreak, the surface has spent the longest time cooling, and when the sun starts coming up again, the angle is still not high enough to heat the surface until a little bit later.

Keep in mind that blackholes are the outcome of equations that treat space as infinitely divisible (no plank unit) and that aren't compatible with quantum mechanics.

Some believe that a further level of collapse is possible beyond a neutron star to an unknown star type that we haven't seen yet - quark stars are the common term.

Is being an engineer more enjoyable than going through engineering school? COVID has taken everything out of me when it comes to studying. I've been in online school since February of 2020: online labs, I took Calc 1-3 online, both physics classes online (I'm EE but I'd assume ME has to take more), and all the labs were online using really bad software. I don't feel like I've learned anything.   I'm wondering if the actual engineering jobs are more enjoyable than the schooling, is there something to look forward to after graduating? Does it just get worse? I don't mind working long hours on something that I enjoy, hell I'll even skip meals if I'm working on a project that I enjoy doing. This school experience just is not what I thought of when I signed up for it.   TIA - sad engineering student\n### Comment:\n",

            "Your body isn't feeling temperature it is feeling the amount of heat leaving your body.  There is a subtle distinction here.  You have 3 variables, the amount of heat the metal can pull away from your body (heat capacity). The amount of heat the metal can store (heat capacity * density, keep in mind metals are heavy). The speed at which the metal can pull away this heat.  (thermal conductivity).  A material which does not conduct heat well will feel warm, because your hand heats up the surface and the heat stays at the surface.  This is why plastics feel warmer then metal.   Metal has a lot of density, a lot of capacity to store heat, and a very good conductivity meaning it can pull the heat out of your body and into the metal very well and it can store a lot of heat.   This is also why different metals feel different temperatures at room temperature.   Not explaining the science: Metal pulls heat out of your body faster then plastic.": 1.0

            "When your body is sick or injured, it will compensate by doing a number of things. Your heart will speed up, you lungs work harder. If you're losing fluid or blood cells through a disease process or injury if will tighten up your veins to make them smaller to increase pressure. Like changing from a big to little garden hose but pushing the same amount of water through. If you're bleeding, your body will push out clotting agents to try to seal the holes.  Eventually, the body can't keep this up. It takes a lot more energy and if the cultprit isn't stopped, the body decompensates. The heart can't keep pumping like it is, clotting factors run out (death by uncontrollable bleeding, internal or internal ), or the disease process itself just outruns the body's ability to compensate.   The body starts prioritizing in hopes of saving the important stuff. The brain and heart being the most important, however, the kidney's need a constant blood supply as well. First the blood vessels in the skin will really tighten up, pushing the blood back into the body. This is why sick people are pale. Then the digestive organs. Then the kidneys, then the liver ect. At this point, the person probably isn't getting enough blood to be completely conscious.

In the case of your daughter's friend, I'm not sure what happened.  We usually see this happen in cases of sepsis.  Basically the infection causes cytokine release which opens little holes in the blood vessels, causing blood pressure to drop.  This means that organs don't receive adequate blood flow and suffer ischemia and can't function.  We try to overcome this with fluids and medications to attempt to maintain adequate blood pressure.

After the destruction of the second Death Star the New Republic spent a little while trying to clean out what was left of the empire. Most of them were taken care of, but a chunk went off into the unknown regions to form the first order and rebuild.   While the First Order rebuilt, the New Republic was sorta getting its footing. They decided to demilitarize since they wanted to encourage peace as much as possible after the civil war, and didn\u2019t think they had any real threats they needed a military for. Leia and the people who went on to form the resistance didn\u2019t agree. They knew the First Order was out there and a threat, but once word got out Leia was Vader\u2019s daughter, a lot of the New Republic stopped trusting her. So she went off to start up the resistance to do what the Republic would not while the New Republic continued to demilitarize.   Then the FO came out and obliterated the central government of the New Republic and all that was left really was scattered local militaries and the resistance.

The higher temp you heat to, the longer it takes you to cool it down so I melt it to just above 100F (38C) and stir it until it falls to 92F (33C) and then use it. The thing about beta crystals is they're like the cool kids in high school. Once other molecules see how to line up and form betas, they follow suit and make more beta crystals and over crystallize your chocolate which is why it gets so thick event though it's the same temp as earlier.

            "I haven't done thermo or fluids in a few years, so hopefully I'm remembering correctly.   Getting the high temperature closer to the low temperature of the system should help, by reducing the amount of heat you have to put in. But you also have to consider how much the fluid expands as it turns from liquid to gas. The expansion is what determines how much work you can extract. Efficiency is a ratio of heat in vs work out  Edit: u/Flyinwatabottle is right. What I said about the temperatures is backwards. After reviewing the Carnot efficiency formula, is seems you want to maximize the temperature difference, not minimize it": 0.0,
            "The answer to \"can you do it\" is absolutely, yes.  You could get a toy steam engine, fill it with alcohol, set up for safety in light of the resulting fire hazard, and it would likely run just fine.  To answer the question of whether it's done in practice, the answer is probably yes, but it wouldn't be called a steam engine.  So first some terminology.  There are actually many types of steam engines: using pistons vs. using turbines; and then cycles that use the water once through vs. systems that condense it and re-use it.  So we often talk about \"thermodynamic cycles\" rather than \"steam engines\", and the fluid used is called the \"working fluid\" to be more general than just steam/water.  If we use something other than water, we almost surely want a closed cycle, where we condense and re-use the fluid.  One high-performance cycle that does that is the Rankine cycle.  You can make a Rankine cycle engine with many different fluids.  Of course water, being cheap and having a convenient temperature/pressure range is most common.  But sometimes people use fluids such as those used as refrigerants (in the past CFCs, now HFCs, but HFCs are now being phased out because of their global warming inpact) in Rankine cycles because they can work better if you want to run at a relatively low temperature and still get good pressure.  An example application is generating electricity from geothermal or waste heat, where you don't have the high temperatures typically used in a steam cycle.  These generally go under the name organic Rankine cycle (link to wikipedia article).": 1.0

            "Notice that oil is liquid at room temperature, while butter is semi-solid. Oil provides more of a moist mouthfeel than butter in baked goods. However, oil is also flavourless (assuming a neutral oil of course), while butter has that rich flavour that is so important in cooking.  Vanilla cakes have a very subtle flavour, hence the flavour from butter is very important. On the other hand, chocolate overpowers the flavour of butter, so it's possible to substitute it out for oil for its moistness without noticing much loss of flavour.   Outside of just the ingredients themselves, there's also the mixing methods. A butter-based cake is usually mixed by the creaming method, where the butter and sugar(s) are creamed together. This isn't simply to just combine the two ingredients, but also to create small air cells within the butter that will allow for additional leavening during baking. This process is known as \"mechanical leavening\", since you're creating leavening from mechanical mixing. Here's an article from Stella Parks that goes further in-depth on how it works.   If oil is used instead of butter, then you won't get the leavening from the creaming process, so you end up with a denser product. This is probably why the oil-based batters you've had feel more like a muffin.": 1.0

If interest is calculated once, at the end of the year, you would have $2000, right?  Suppose I now say the annual rate is still 100% but I'll calculate the interest and add it on to your original amount every six months.  (So 50% return each half year).    This would make you $250 better off!  (As you now *also* get the second half of the year's 50% on the first half of the year's $500 interest.)  So, the more often we calculate the interest, the better - even though the yearly return is still 100%  Let's take it further.   If the interest calculation was monthly, then the yearly return would be $1613.  So 2.61 times your starting amount by me just splitting your 100% return into smaller slices.  So the question is - how far can we take this?  What effective return would we get if we recalculated daily?  hourly?  every minute?  Well it turns out that the answer is 'e'.    If we could recalculate the 100% interest every second or less then we would get end up with $2718.28": 0.0,

It turns out that you'll find an 'e' in the equation you'll need to describe this slope - e is 2.7 and change. The equation  y=e^(x) creates a curve whose slope (rate of change) is equal to its value at every point.     So lots of things in nature involve this kind of growth - like a colony of bacteria where the rate of growth depends on the number of bacteria in it. It's very special in calculus, as y=e^(x) is unaffected by derivatives.

            "\"In the eight years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate.\"    The keyword here is \"known\".  There have always been enhanced individuals, but after Tony Stark announced himself to the world, he basically changed the public consciousness and people became okay with the idea of there being superheroes.  Previously Steve Rogers was openly a superhero, but this was partly due to how he was exploited by the US government for propaganda purposes. Aside from Captain America, the existence of aliens like the Asgardians was confined to the realm of myths and legends, Hank Pym's shrink tech was kept strictly confidential, other super soldiers like Isiah Bradley and the Red Guardian were kept hush hush by their governments, the incident with the Skrulls and Captain Marvel was covered up, Wakanda pretended to be an impoverished nation, sorcerers largely kept to themselves in Kamar-Taj and the Sanctums, etc.  But now, with Iron Man basically saying, \"Yeah, superheroes exist, deal with it,\" people could accept the existence of people with extraordinary abilities, so the need to cover things up was no longer as pressing.  So the US government and military didn't really bother to cover up the Hulk and the Abomination.  They were all like, \"Yeah, these guys broke Harlem.\" The attempt to cover up Thor's arrival was also pretty half-assed. And then the Avengers came together to fight the Chitauri in the Battle of New York, and after that pretty much everyone with enhanced abilities felt comfortable about appearing in public (Stephen Strange, T'Challa, Peter Parker, Scott Lang, etc).": 1.0

They stop eating the striped ones but keep eating the brown ones (and spitting them out). The poisonous ones with no red stripes are thus weeded out of the gene pool and all of the poisonous offspring now only have red stripes. Over time, those red stripes get larger and larger as the caterpillars with bolder red stripes are less likely to accidentally get eaten and thus the genes for bold bright warning colors are more likely to be spread in the gene pool of poisonous animals.

Back when I was in high school, I learned the discipline of mathematics and the art of going from an individual case to a general extrapolation or formula. I kind of need that for cooking too, now.  Most of the books I am presented with are basically just a list of recipes.  As I like better to experiment in my kitchen than to follow recipes, I'm seeking a book that explains why recipes work the way they do. I'm always happy to diverge from recipes I read, main reason being I couldn't gather exactly the ingredients proposed by said recipe (in recipe books they are kind of fancy, for some reason).  It would be a book that explains simple cooking actions, in example:  * why should I practice one cutting technique over another one * why can I put a spice to heat and not another one * what are the optimal time of heating for each vegetable * how to make beans really soft like they do in canned food  I think such things are helpful and will allow me to not fall into easy traps. In example lately I've used a lot of red palm oil to try cooking a pilaf rice, and the greasiness of it all was not very delicious.  Probably this is the kind of book that's used when learning to become a chef, right?  If the book can be found on google books it's even better but if not I'll try to get a physical copy of it.

Complete the request to the best of your ability.\n\n### Instruction:\nWrite a comment to the reddit post from the subreddit r/askculinary that would receive as many upvotes as possible.\n### Post Content\nCan you recommend technical books that list techniques rather than recipes? Back when I was in high school, I learned the discipline of mathematics and the art of going from an individual case to a general extrapolation or formula. I kind of need that for cooking too, now.  Most of the books I am presented with are basically just a list of recipes.  As I like better to experiment in my kitchen than to follow recipes, I'm seeking a book that explains why recipes work the way they do. I'm always happy to diverge from recipes I read, main reason being I couldn't gather exactly the ingredients proposed by said recipe (in recipe books they are kind of fancy, for some reason).  It would be a book that explains simple cooking actions, in example:  * why should I practice one cutting technique over another one * why can I put a spice to heat and not another one * what are the optimal time of heating for each vegetable * how to make beans really soft like they do in canned food  I think such things are helpful and will allow me to not fall into easy traps. In example lately I've used a lot of red palm oil to try cooking a pilaf rice, and the greasiness of it all was not very delicious.  Probably this is the kind of book that's used when learning to become a chef, right?  If the book can be found on google books it's even better but if not I'll try to get a physical copy of it.

The problem with ICE is their efficiency, especially because they cannot operate at their peak efficiency point in a traditional vehicle. The problem with EVs is their range and recharge points. Hybrids at the moment can use the engine to drive the car, but start and stop the engine frequently and operate it in the entire range of inefficiency to drive the car.  Why is there not a vehicle on the market with a medium battery (15kWh) and range (60 miles) paired with a tiny engine whose only purpose is to recharge the battery? The engine would not drive the car directly, and so its output does not have to meet the peak power demand during acceleration. Instead, the engine (functioning only as small generator) starts running when the battery is low, or if the driver knows they are going on a commute longer than the standard range then they can activate the generator the moment they leave the house to extend the range. The generator may not be able to recharge the battery at the same rate as power consumed on the highway, but even if it runs out of range the car can be parked and slowly recharged by the generator if a charging station is now nearby.   A vehicle consuming 15kW at 60 mph, with a 10kW generator running could extend the range by 40 miles by the time the original charge is depleted. And extend by about 70 miles total by continuously recharging - over doubling the range. All while running the generator at its peak efficiency point.  Most commutes could be covered by the normal range, and rely only on at home charging. Being able to double the range while operating the ICE/generator at peak efficiency would be beneficial. Hybrids already have the hardware, why isn't this different implementation being used instead?  If not feasible for passanger vehicles, would something like this be better suited for 18-wheelers?",

            "This paper discusses the ramifications, and is fairly readable: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.2821.pdf  Mainly, a photon having the maximum possible mass that could decay into the lightest neutrino, given how thermal the cosmic microwave background is, would have a lifetime of about three years, which is extended to much longer than the current age of the universe because of relativistic effects. The paper also talks about the implications that it would have, and they aren't disastrous.  The biggest thing is that \"the speed that light travels\" and \"the speed associated with Lorentz transformations\" are no longer the same thing.": 0.0,
            "Massive photons would have a few big effects:  Photons wouldn't actually travel at the \"speed of light\". They'd travel at something less than this.  The electromagnetic interaction would have a characteristic length scale, like the Weak force does, because it's force carrier would be a massive particle. The Weak force is \"weak\" because the force carrying particles are so heavy. The lighter the force carrier, the larger the distance the force is effective, and vice versa.   Massive photons would be unstable, and decay into other things. The heavier the mass, the shorter the stable lifetime. This is still consistent with our Universe, because the photon's mass could be small enough to give you particles that appear stable over the lifetime of the Universe, but aren't actually, say, for 1,000 times the current age of the Universe.   These three effects (or lack there of) can be measured, especially those last two. We know that photons appear stable, so their mass must be less than or equal to a mass that would give them a lifetime >= the current age of the Universe.  The electromagnetic force appears to work on all distance scales, but we can't build a laboratory that is the Universe wide, and so we have seen the E&M forces act on scales large enough to put limits on the mass of a photon.   Edit:  Yes, as several people have pointed out, I mis-typed. They COULD decay, but they wouldn't HAVE to decay. There are other things that would have to exist/be true for massive photons to decay.": 1.0

            "Only about 5% of the energy released by a nuclear bomb is turned into ionizing radiation (alpha, beta, gamma, neutron). But the larger the bomb does not mean that the radiating energy spreads any farther than smaller bombs. Beyond a certain point the physical energy (heat, compression wave, etc) completely overrides the damage done by the radiation. It is the neutron radiation, however, that causes physical material to become radioactive by forming isotopes of the existing atoms. The fallout that is generated after the bomb goes off is the physical material that has been bombarded by neutrons and then burnt and turned to ash.  So, the radioactive material that is the fallout, is created by the radiation generated by the initial blast. There is also some residual physical material that may not have been completely destroyed by the compression wave and heat, but for the most part that is negligible compared to the material distributed as fallout.": 0.0,
            ">I realize that it's almost instantaneously burned, but I'm wondering if the radiation comes from the initial blast or entirely from the fallout, which I thought was just ash.  Short answer: yes.  The initial radiation takes the form of gamma and neutron radiation - this radiation dissipates relatively quickly (lasts about the length of the explosion). Very few injuries would result from initial radiation alone - as most people affected by this also happen to be close to ground zero and have other worries (e.g. giant fireball).  Fallout is what comes next. There are hundreds of fissile products that can be formed from a nuclear blast - some with a very short half-life (like iodine 131), and some that will stick around for months or years (like strontium 90). This can come from the weapon debris (e.g. \"leftover\" plutonium), products from the fission itself, and much of it will be from irradiated soil (assuming you're detonating it near the ground).  So, I think your question is more about the after-effects - so to answer: the radiation you're seeing that has long term effects is from the fallout.  edit: Grammar - as per Vanabrus :)": 1.0

My new landlord has asked me and my 2 roommates to leave so that he can move his family into our unit. We are signed on a lease until November. Can he legally serve us an eviction notice before our lease ends? Assuming the answer is yes, does anyone have any advice on how to get out of this? Details below!  My roommates and I live in a 3 bedroom apt in Bedstuy, BK. We signed a 1 year lease last November and at that same time, our building was sold to a new owner. A few days ago, I got a call from the new owner asking me how many months of notice we would need to move out--he wants to move his family into our unit. He and his wife currently live in a 1 bedroom with their kid and another on the way. He said he wants our unit (1 of 3 in the building) because it is on the top floor and would be the most quiet.  I know that we are protected by the lease until November to an extent. As you can imagine, my roommates and are I not willing to submit right away--we are all very happy with our living arrangement. I also realize that if he wants to evict us, he probably can. We're hoping to learn more about situations like these so that we can figure out how to stay put.

We are signed on a lease until November. My new landlord has asked me and my 2 roommates to leave so that he can move his family into our unit. We are signed on a lease until November. Can he legally serve us an eviction notice before our lease ends? Assuming the answer is yes, does anyone have any advice on how to get out of this? Details below!  My roommates and I live in a 3 bedroom apt in Bedstuy, BK. We signed a 1 year lease last November and at that same time, our building was sold to a new owner. A few days ago, I got a call from the new owner asking me how many months of notice we would need to move out--he wants to move his family into our unit. He and his wife currently live in a 1 bedroom with their kid and another on the way. He said he wants our unit (1 of 3 in the building) because it is on the top floor and would be the most quiet.  I know that we are protected by the lease until November to an extent. As you can imagine, my roommates and are I not willing to submit right away--we are all very happy with our living arrangement. I also realize that if he wants to evict us, he probably can. We're hoping to learn more about situations like these so that we can figure out how to stay put.  Any comments, questions and advice are much appreciated.\n### Comment:\n",

            "This is actually a really good question, and a proper answer would take quite a bit of work, as well as a lot of complicated math.  I have a master's degree in physics, and I still had to think hard about some aspects of your question (it is after 1AM where the live after all).  Instead of giving you the answers straight away, I'd like to nudge you in the direction of how a physicists might approach a problem like this.  An excellent way to start a problem is to think about what sort of symmetry you can take advantage of.  Normally shaped planets like the Earth have spherical symmetry (or close enough).  Since a sphere looks the same no matter how you rotate it, you know that the strength of gravity from a sphere won't depend on the direction, and that it can only depend on how far away you are from the center.  What sort of symmetry does a donut planet have? If a moon were orbiting around a donut planet, would it matter which way around it goes?  Another way to get insight for problems like this is to consider limiting cases.  What I mean by that is, look as an extreme situation, where the problem is easier, and apply what you learn to help solve the more general problem.  Imagine you're an ant on the surface of your donut planet. Which way would you expect gravity to pull you? If the donut is really thin, and stretched out like a hoolahoop, would you expect there to be a big difference between the inside of the hoop and the outside? What if it's a fat donut with a really small hole?  Hope you find that helpful :)": 0.0,

            "Binary it's really better than any other system, it just happens to be the simplest and easiest to design.  Any theoretical increase in performance has to be weighed against the additional work needed to design it, and in almost every case it just isn't worth it to do computation using something other than binary.  Designing hardware to operate on boolean logic is dead-simple, since you only have two states you can peg your logic voltage levels at the limits of your power supply and not really worry about it.  Determining logic levels becomes a matter of \"Is it below X volts?  Logic 0.  Is it above Y volts? Logic 1\".  This can be done pretty easily and wickedly fast, both essential properties for making fast circuits.  With >2 states, hardware complexity takes a decidedly nasty leap forward.  It's a lot harder to make digital hardware that operates on 3 or more discrete logic levels than one that works off two since you have to include additional hardware to discriminate between them at every step of the process; you can't use the supply limits as easy references anymore since you'll have a third logic level floating somewhere in the middle that's annoyingly difficult to efficiently detect with great accuracy compared to how easy it is to differentiate just two.  That said, it's very common for circuitry to have a quasi-logic level called 'high impedance' or just 'high-Z'.  Putting a logic line into high-Z effectively disconnects it entirely from any other inputs or outputs it's connected to, allowing useful functions like multiplexing lines together that you're sure will never have to drive it at the same time.  It isn't true ternary operation since it really isn't a \"true\" logic level, but it's a quick glimpse into the strangeness that goes on when digital circuit design meets the real-world analog craziness that reality consists of.": 1.0

            "It has a lot to do with timing. With authentic stir frying, you're never actually cooking the garlic and ginger for very long in the wok.  With many western recipes, the garlic (less often ginger) is meant to cook alongside the other ingredients, which are often cooked from raw to full doneness. This usually takes a while and by the time other ingredients are finished, the garlic will have burned, so it's practical to toss the garlic in later on in the process.  However, with a lot of stir frying, the ingredients are often already par-cooked or cut into very small or thin pieces to cook incredibly quickly. The garlic and ginger are meant to infuse the oil with flavor before other ingredients are tossed in to heat up and coat in the aromatic oils. Because they cook for so little time, you want the oil to already be very infused with the aromatics, so the ginger and garlic go in first. And because the ingredients cook so quickly, the ginger and garlic are less prone to burn by the time the dish is ready.": 0.0,
            "When sweating aromatics you'll add garlic last as to not burn it. The same applies while stir-frying although it gets added first. It's to flavor the wok's oil. You almost immediately add other ingredients to cool the oil and stop the garlic from burning.": 1.0

            "Partial melting of the substrate is uncommon (at least I'm not aware of this being common and certainly isn't the case for preserved lava flows I've seen in the field, and I can really only imagine this being possible in extremely selective settings on a very small scale where a high temperature lava, e.g. basalt, was erupted onto something with an extremely low melting point, e.g. carbonate, where you could possibly get a tiny bit of partial melting. But the lava flow will lose heat so quickly at its margins, generally it will not be able to melt other rocks). Alteration of the substrate (i.e. some amount of physical erosion, breaking up of the material from boiling of fluids, 'baking' previously unlithified sediments/soils) is very common. The wikipedia article on lava provides a little description. The base of the lava flow itself also is affected by contact with a much cooler substrate. The portions of the lava in direct contact will start to solidify (and these bits will have a very fine grained texture because they cool quickly) but the interior is still hot enough to remain liquid and so the flow continues, which will tend to rip up these partially cooled bits and drag them along (with the cooling process continuing for new bits of lava that come into direct contact with the cool substrate). This can end up leaving the base of the flow with a brecciated texture (but this is again for the volcanic material itself, not the substrate). There are lots of places where we can observe cross sections of volcanic stratigraphy to get a view of the variety of the basal contacts of lava flows. Here is an example of a paper (hopefully available to everyone, hard to tell since I'm at work) describing the volcanic stratigraphy in Iceland, which gives a lot of great details of how the texture of flows vary in cross-section and some discussion of the substrates.   Caveat: I study non-volcanic mountains, so I'm still hoping a volcanologist will show up to provide more detail.": 1.0

My reasons for moving were completely different between the two - the first I wanted more money, and the second I wasn't learning anything and took a significant pay cut to move. My caveats to you are this - use other offers as leverage if you are happy at your current company, but you have to actually be willing to move if they call your bluff. And second, if you move too much, you will never advance in your career. You will be a 2-3 year engineer ten times over, and never grow fully. I hate seeing resumes like that.": 0.0,
            "I switched jobs lots. I think I've had three retirement parties at the tender age of 32...and each move was to a different industry, all within engineering.  Switching jobs (assuming you're competent), will greatly boost your pay compared to staying put, help you develop a variety of skillsets, improve the network of people you know, and set you up better to figure out what you want to be when you grow up.  You'll also learn how vastly different different company cultures are - a good fit for one person isn't a good fit for everyone.  Staying in a job proves you're a loyal, good worker, and low risk for having to replace you. Most companies don't give a shit about you, so this is all benefit for them, none for you - except you get to get a little complacent if you choose.  Occasionally you'll find a gem job that you love, treats you awesome, and pays you well.  In that situation, you'll have to decide what your long term plans are you, and act accordingly.  Switching jobs is really what allowed me to go freelance and then begin building my own company.  Figure out what YOU want to do - that helps a lot.": 1.0

The vise, meanwhile, doesn't need to use muscle fibers; the metal itself is elastic, and will store a HUGE amount of stress by flexing barely-measurable amounts.\\* Your arms can't store up stress to release it later, they just apply force in one direction at a time.   \\*Fun fact: that's why it's so loud when metal gives out under load; it's an incredibly firm 'spring.'": 0.0,

            "Physics often use incredibly specific definitions of terms that are common in normal language. This is complicated when people who are perhaps under qualified make videos about it. Let's define the terms as physicists use them:  -Locality: (this word is actually a whole can of worms but here's a basic description) The information needed to describe something localised within some area is the information local to it. A particle feels forces due to the value of fields where the particle is. You hear someone shout at you because the pressure waves reached your ear etc   -Reality: the description of a system is everything and nothing else is there. In classical mechanics this is true, I collect all the info about my particles and can predict the future of them and then I can measure the velocities and positions in the future. In quantum theory we have superpositions but we never see them, the state \"collapses\" into one of them with some probability. The states it can collapse into and the probabilities are completely predicted by QM but not which state it will collapse into.  Einstein wanted a description that was local and real, something that had only local effects and completely predicted the outcomes of experiments. No fundamental probabilities, he thought there should be some local dynamics under the hood that we were simply unaware of. The Nobel prize was for experiments that showed that the universe doesn't satisfy those two requirements at the same time. These experiments used entanglement, which cannot be explained with a locally real theory, called local hidden variables.": 1.0

Even if they are both 4\" across, the waffle has all those ridges which create more surface area and thus browning. By adding oil, this enhances the browning making it even better. Once you get into adding toppings, those ridges also collect butter/syrup/whatever, instead of letting them run off the food, making it even tastier.  In a similar vein, toast tastes better than bread because of the browning, even when using the same bread.": 1.0

            "Of your list, option B and C, unless they were stored really, really poorly.  Spices are 'spices' because they contain varying amounts of organic compounds that are responsible for both taste and smell ^1 . Oxygen, that pesky molecule, is actually an incredibly aggressive and corrosive agent with co-dependency issues ^2  and breaks up and breaks off those compounds.  Best case scenario with very expired spices is you added a nice shake of inert organic carbon to your carbonara. Worst case is they've gotten wet and can act as a medium for bacterial/fungal growth.  1. (which are kinda the same sense, but that's a different TED talk)  2. (assigning psycho-social disorders to the Periodic Table is yet another different TED talk)": 0.0,
            "When we talk about expiration in food, there are 2 types of expiration: food safety expiration (typically worded \"use by\") and food quality expiration (typically worded \"best before\")  Most spices don't have a \"food safety\" expiration as they're, genetically speaking, not hospitable to bacteria and fungus which is what usually make people sick. They're even used as preservatives.   What they do have is a \"food quality\" expiration, because they have volatile compounds that will disperse into the air (making the spice lose potency) and oxidize (making the spice taste off / rancid / lose color). That happens quicker when they're in powder form. Another thing that can happen is they can absorb moisture and cake into a super hard disk inside your jar, sometimes \"melt\" (usually things like bouillon cubes, premix and the occasional onion / garlic powder are prone to melting)  In your case, I recommend going through the cabinet and tossing everything that looks obviously moldy. Then do a color / sniff / taste test (IN THAT ORDER) of the test and see if it's still good / useable": 1.0

I've heard a lot that you have to change companies every 3-5 years to get promotions and raises beyond the 2-5% annual cost of living raise. I'm happy where I am and I'm not thinking about moving right now,  but I like to keep my eye on what might lie ahead. Honestly, the idea of having to find a new job, interview and negotiate a contract and then get assimilated into a new team every couple of years sounds exhausting.   Has this saying proven true for most people, or what are my alternatives?\n### Comment:\n",

            "\"process\" is just a way to say \"think about what is really going on and making you feel this way.\"  There are several reasons that \"processing\" emotions is recommended, with a very important one being that emotions are generally what are called \"primitive\" responses, the body is reacting to biochemical inputs. \"Processing\" forces you out of the biochemical response mode and into the logical consciousness zone.  Thinking about your emotional state is a way to induce a delay in response and to exercise some control on that response.  Those chemical releases are generally a response to the brain's instructions.  The brain has made some decisions, typically automatic response using learned behaviors, and caused the dumping of chemicals into the bloodstream, so processing emotions also helps you figure out what is TRULY responsible for your emotional response.  This sort of evaluation is used in Cognitive Therapy, which is basically an attempt to get the person to see what is the source of their emotional responses and how to counter the effects when exposed to such sources, and/or how to avoid or minimize the impact of exposure to such sources.   The primary purpose of being advised to \"Process\" your emotions is to remove your actions from your learned (trained) set of responses`to place a small delay into the mix, give you time to reduce the intensity of your response.  Sort of like counting to 10.  The secondary reason is so you can figure out what the heck the real problems are and what to do to make things less disruptive to you.  You can't \"fix\" something if you do not know what is truly the problem.  My problem was anger and let me tell you, letting anger take control is not a good thing.  Took a lot of work to retrain myself.": 0.0,
            "I'm an addict with ten years sobriety, have worked extensively on this. Any emotion I experience, my addiction wants me to use as a solution to it. Therefore I have to really understand my emotions to stay sober.  Explain like I'm five years old: Emotions are like the weather. There's no good or bad weather. A sunny day sounds nice when you're at the amusement park, but what if it starts to rain? A cold day doesn't sound fun, but what if you're all bundled up and have hot cocoa, then it sounds nice :)  Emotions are like the weather and they'll go away in time.  non Explain like I'm five years old: There are eight primary emotions: anger, fear, sadness, disgust, surprise, anticipation, trust and joy. None are good or bad, just pleasant and unpleasant. Surprisingly all emotions will pass in as little as 90 seconds, usually no longer than three minutes, unless you engulf on them (listening to sad music when you're sad, looking at pictures of your ex, etc.)  The example I give is opening presents. That sounds delightful. But what if you opened presents for an hour? What about two hours? At a certain point even that begins to sound miserable. This whole notion of \"I want to be happy all the time\" is kinda fucked up.   Going back to the presents example... at a certain point you have to read an instruction manual, go buy batteries, play a tutorial, you have to do the boring or tedious stuff to enjoy your presents and generate new levels of happiness.  So to process your emotions is to recognize you're experiencing a multitude of feelings, and then just sort of ride it out without engulfing til you get back to a baseline.   My friends threw a surprise party for my birthday this year. I went home for about an hour til I had to go to another birthday dinner. I was overwhelmed, I was happy from the party, sad it was over, nervous about dinner. The whole thing left me physically tired. So I sat and experienced the emotions and got to kind of a \"neutral\" place, and then focused on going to dinner and having a nice time there (I did)": 1.0

What About Bruce's Family? I understand that Thomas and Martha, being from insanely rich old money type families, would absolutely each have a will in the case of their early passing. And it even makes sense that they would trust him as a legal guardian for Bruce. However, my question comes down to Bruce's other relatives. We know that his mother's side of the family, the Kanes, were still alive, so why weren't they given custody of Bruce or even bother trying to get it?\n### Comment:\n",

For an opposite view- have you ever had your hands so absolutely freezing cold that when you put them in what should be cold water, it feels warm? And actual warm or hot water is so hot it stings? You need to gradually warm your hands up under room temp water before you can turn it higher.   Your cells need time to react to the change in temp.

            "This may get a bit technical, but the very hand-wavy stuff is: the dimples are really ever only useful for spheres, and for spheres that move at very specific speeds (or of very specific sizes).  The reason why is that a sphere is a bluff body with some very weird properties when it moves at relatively high speeds. We add dimples on top of spheres to get a more regular flow around the back of the sphere, which is the critical part, but in doing so you are adding some drag. It turns out that the drag you get with dimples is less than the drag you lose by improving the flow on the back of the sphere, so it works there.  On the other hand, the fuselage of an airplane doesn't really have this kind of problems. The back of the fuselage usually is pointed, making for an already decent enough flow on the back. What's more, for very complex reasons I won't explain, the dimples make the flow turbulent for the golf ball, but the air is already turbulent near the airplane, so it wouldn't have any effect if not increasing drag the same way it did for spheres.": 1.0

Quite likely, the patient was exposed to French as a young child, but later forgot this until the accident.  A similar case involved an English gentleman who suffered a stroke and later found he could speak Welsh -- in fact, at first, he could *only* speak Welsh, and it took a while for his English to come back. But in this case, his personal history could explain the phenomenon: during World War 2, as a child, he was an evacuee -- along with many other children, he was taken from the big city, out of the way of German bombing raids, and stayed with a family in the country. In his case, he was assigned a family in Wales. Although he didn't himself speak Welsh, he heard Welsh spoken around him all the time. It seems that he built up a latent ability to speak the language that was only \"unlocked\" decades later when his stroke by chance affected just the right part of his brain in exactly the right way.

When you think of the three phases in three phase power you think about the hot legs (at least that's how I was thinking of them) but the phasing really refers to the circuit. So A isn't a phase, A to B is a phase. The sub station is sending out 3 phase 3 wire (ground doesn't count) and the bucket transformers you see take one of those phases (or two wires) and step that down and add a neutral wire which gives you your 120/240 at your home. Larger buildings will take all three wires and give 120/208 but will send power to the individual units as if there were only the two incoming wires. So your three phases again aren't A, B, C but rather A - B, B - C, C- A.  As for how they manage, you... okay so it's kinda like how rando off the street can't sing, but you get a concert full of randos and they sound like they can. The wide area interconnect does a pretty good job of averaging out. Pretty good but not perfect.

When phase imbalance becomes enough of a problem we just go and rewire houses to different phases in that area.  If you didn't have smart meters you'd be stuck looking at data from pole top devices or your substation data (HV 3 phase current loads etc). In this instance you don't know specifically which houses are causing more load than others but you'll see that one phase is overloaded so again, field crews would rewire connections away from that phase in the area.  Solar creates additional complexity. My company has to do pretty complex network load flow analysis for connections these days as we've seen large uptake in some areas.

Cook down the onion, then add the mushrooms once the onions are translucent and cook until the water is half cooked out, then add the peppers and garlic and continue until the peppers are soft (the moisture in the pan will keep the garlic from burning and the mushrooms will finish cooking off while the peppers cook). I agree with the top comment that recommends blanching the broccoli, then add that. Add the cherry tomatoes and continue cooking until they pop, or add them right at the end if you want them whole (personally I like adding them whole and then getting them to the popping stage). Finish with starchy pasta water and a little extra virgin olive oil or butter when it's off the heat.": 1.0

            "Two reasons -  1. Both Mom and Dad are examples of sounds that really easy for babies to say, they come from a core set of sounds that the human mouth is able to process first. Along with the babbling / repetition of Momma and Dada. That's just a core human habit irrespective of culture. 2. The majority of languages from Europe to India are theorized as having developed from a single, prehistoric mother language we now call \"Proto-Indo-European\", or PIE for short. The idea is about 5,000 years ago the language spread out among the nomadic tribes of early human civilization. People settled down and the languages started to evolve from there into Celtic, or Greek, or Latin, or Germanic and even Sanskrit languages.

            "Your homemade ice cream with a non-compressor maker can be outstanding. Ice cream is much more dependent on recipe / ingredients / technique than maker.   Source: have made so much ice cream, in professional models, in freezer bowl models, and in at-home compressor models.   I will note that a lot of fancy people, like Heston Blumenthal, disagree with me and they say if you're not making it real quick you're losing out. The theory is that super-quick freezing will make smaller ice crystals (which is true) and that yields a better texture. But the right technique and recipe will also yield a delightful texture.   The obvious thing that a compressor model can do that a freezer bowl model can't is make multiple batches in a row. The less obvious thing that a compressor model can do that a freezer bowl model can't is handle certain recipes that require a lot of freezing, like salted caramel, say.": 0.0,
            "Ice cream texture is a function of recipe, overrun, and freezing time. Recipe is the easy part, but overrun and freezing time are entirely a function of the ice cream machine you use. Non-compressor machines will typically give you a freezing time of 20-30 minutes while a compressor will give you 12-18 minutes, both for 1 L of base. That difference in time has a significant impact on the texture of the ice cream. Overrun depends on the paddle type and rotation speed of the machine, but most home machines will provide a similar overrun - very high overrun typically requires commercial machines.  You'll want to look for a machine with the shortest freezing time possible. Something like a Lello 4080 is ideal but there are cheaper options available like the Breville Smart Scoop or the Cuisinart ICE-100. The more you pay the better the result generally, and when it comes to ice cream machines the price can skyrocket pretty fast, so you'll have to decide what is reasonable for your budget (and counter space).": 1.0

By the time I cook in the afternoon or in the evening, it's good to go and works quite well as a buttermilk sub. Or if you're making pancakes, you can do it at night and come to it in the morning.  As an aside, if you use cream (even UHT cream) and do the same thing for a full 24 hours, together with a tiny splash of vinegar to taste you can make a very convincing sour cream substitute.   If you don't feel like going through that whole song and dance, you can also just use yoghurt straight up, though note that it'll have a bit more of that yoghurt-y tang to it. Usually still quite tasty, but would be a touch different of a flavor than the recipe writer was envisioning.

A millionaire friend of mine is starting a company around a specific gluten free item and they asked me to invent a receipt for them because they couldn\u2019t figure it out.

It's about how to make Gordon's creamy scrambled eggs without them sticking. Cold pan, cold solid butter and eggs to start. High heat. Stir until they start to cook then remove from heat. Keep stirring throughout and place back on the heat after a few seconds and repeat.  You can try a nice, new non-stick pan but, in my experience, there's always some cleanup with this style. It's great for a relaxed Saturday morning with a significant other and not great for a quick Tuesday morning breakfast.

I was so excited to find key limes in the store that I thought it made perfect sense to use them! But does anyone know if that could be the reason the filling was so bitter? Are key limes bitter? I\u2019ve never used them or bought them before this.   I really should have been tasting as I went along, but could this have been avoided by using less juice from the key limes?    Thanks in advance!\n### Comment:\n",

            "Nothing is 100% safe.  But it's not that big a danger.  Aside from the proportion of eggs which contain salmonella in the US (very small) there is the simple fact that the bacteria doesn't really reproduce in mayo.  Think about it, aside from maybe one egg, the ingredients are oil and some spices, and some acid.  None of these encourage growth, and the danger of salmonella contamination is in the bacteria multiplying.  Please treat this as anecdotal, as I can't find the reference where  I read it, but the whole reputation for bad mayonnaise comes from summer salads.  Even if there is a little salmonella in the mayo (and as I said, unlikely) it's not going to make anyone sick.  You can leave the mayo on the counter all day.  But...  You mix it with some sugar and a bunch of starch, as in making a potato salad or pasta salad and leave that out, well you can have a problem.  You just fed that bacteria it's favorite foods and incubated it.": 0.0,
            "Raw eggs are not inherently unsafe.   All food safety regulation is simply about mitigating risk. Because honestly, nothing we eat is without risk of some kind.  Eggs can be infected by salmonella in one of two ways: First, bacteria can be passed from an infected hen to her eggs as they develop inside her. Chickens can be vaccinated against this to mitigate that type of risk. Second, it can grow on the outside of the shell after an egg is laid if it comes in contact with a hen\u2019s poop that contains salmonella.  In the US, the USDA requires eggs sold for consumption to be washed, processed, and then refrigerated. Washing them ensures that any salmonella that was present on the outside of the shells is removed. But- there's a trade off. Washing eggs removes the thin, filmy, protective outer layer called the cuticle. This cuticle is the natural shield that keeps bacteria out of an egg while letting oxygen circulate.   On the other hand, most European and Asian countries do the opposite and require that table eggs not be wet-washed, and also not refrigerated, because they still have their protective cuticle. Its thus recommended that non-washed eggs be washed immediately before consumption to remove any trace amounts of poop.  Both regulations were arrived at as effective ways to solve the same problem: reducing exposure to salmonella, a bacteria that causes unpleasant, though non-life-threatening, illness.    Additionally, cooking isn't the only way to ensure food safety. Other ingredients like acid and salt in things like mayo and salad dressings help to create an environment that is less friendly to bacteria growth.  In the US, the CDC estimates Salmonella bacteria cause about 1.35 million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths in the United States every year and that *most people recover without specific treatment.* Infants, adults aged 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems are the most likely to have severe infections.  Most establishments will note on their menus any items that contain raw eggs so that people can make their own decisions whether or not to consume them.": 1.0

            "If I understand right, you're trying to give the meat an outer sear (which also puts some fond in the pot) on the hob and to finish the rest of the cooking process in the oven (I assume there are additional steps inbetween.).  The reason for doing the browning/searing on the hob/stove is that you get a nice hot surface that can actually do a sear, exactly what you do with a fry pan.  The oven simply doesn't give you a hot enough surface to achieve a sear.  The searing process develops flavour (Maillard reaction).  Doing it in the pot makes it easier to prepare in and retain flavour because all the fond is developed in and stays in the cooking vessel.  If you don't do the searing process, you can end up with a grey meat which can be visually unappealing.  You also don't get a lot of the complex flavours from the caramelization from the Maillard reaction.  The secondary cooking in the oven (pot with the lid on) allows for a much slower, gentler and more controlled way of thoroughly cooking the meat.  Brisket needs to be cooked slowly as it is a really tough cut of meat (lots of connective tissue) with lots of fat; cooking it fast on a high heat will just give you a tough and chewy mass.  It's why you see so many slow cooker recipes for it to make it \"so tender that the meat falls apart\".  Keeping the lid on helps retain moisture.  Although you can leave a gap for moisture to leave near the end of cooking to allow for the sauces to thicken.  EDIT: Updated based on comment below.": 0.0,

If you want a solution, what single-ply needs to do is actually be less absorbent and less smooth. By absorbing a lot of water it becomes weaker because it is so absorbent, and by being as smooth as it is it doesn't pick up much of the actual solid material that we are trying to get rid of. By making a version of single-ply that has just slightly more hydrophobic fibers and an essentially fuzzier surface, everyone would benefit.

            "To add to /u/Ohairreddit69, whom is correct. In regards to the hadal region, Mariana Trench, we currently do not know we have a few theories but have no direct measurements. I am currently working on figuring this out. One theory is that no there is no circulation in the trench and the water would be the saltiest coldest (most dense) water produced during the last glacial max, and no other water is dense enough to replace it. The other theory is that internal wave that propagate in not just the horizontal but also have a vertical component are mixing the water. If the slope of the trench is just right these waves can be reflected down into the trench mixing the water until homogeny is achieved, similar situations have been found in shallow canyons all over the world.  Source: Current ly (lol) getting masters in Oceanography": 0.0,
            "Ok, my time to shine, hopefully. The deep ocean circulation of water is in fact dominated by a gradient in seawater density. The waters of the ocean are not all homogenised or mixed like one would expect, in fact, they are separated by differences in density based on the overlying waters they were sourced from, and can be categorised as 'water masses'. These differences in density are caused by a difference in the temperature (the colder, the denser) and salinity (the saltier, the denser) of the source waters where they were formed. So when you have a situation where the water that forms above is denser than the water formed previously below, it sinks, and we get what we call in the business 'downwelling'. This only happens at a few points in the sea, most notably the Labrador Sea and some places in the Antarctic. So this really dense water sinks and sinks until it reaches a density that it can no longer sink past. So what happens now? The water is still forming above, so it has to keep moving! As such, it moves horizontally throughout the ocean (on the density isocline). What we have here is something called the 'Thermohaline circulation', and it actually links all the waters of the world oceans together. Here is a diagram.   Hope that explains your question a bit!   Knowledge base (not source): Current PhD student in Oceanography, coming from a Masters in Ocean Sciences.  EDIT: Thanks for the gold fellow fan of the ocean!   EDIT 2: Absolutely astounded by the wonderful amounts of interest my fellow Redditors seem to have in ocean science! Oceans are really important so I'm glad I could help raise interest! I live in Europe, so it's my bed time unfortunately, but if any more questions appear overnight I'll do my best to answer them.": 1.0
