What matters is would enough people who hold powerful positions agree that Hans should be ruler regardless of how flimsy the justification. There have been much flimsier excuses for many kingdoms in the past.  So really the question is - how angry are the people that their queen froze them and left? Angry enough to question her legitimacy? If he can stir up enough populist anger towards the royal family he could easily win the peoples support. If he can get a few key members of the aristocracy on his side.   I reckon he had a decent shot is Anna had died. If he gets some high ranking military general or guards on his side, he can threaten and bully his political opponents.": 0.0,

As such, she is indeed the queen if Elsa abdicates, and one could make a very solid case that refusing to take part in your coronation, throwing away your crown, hiding in the mountains and refusing to come back is a *de facto* abdication.  If Elsa *had* abdicated at that point, Anna was queen. As such, her appointing Hans caretaker ruler is a royal decree. And if she dies, this gives Hans some degree of political authority to declare himself leader based on the late queen's wishes- especially since, with Anna's death, the direct line of succession seems to have ended.  It wouldn't necessarily *work*, but he certainly had a leg to stand on.": 1.0

In some cases you have dramatic differences in size/etc that make mating impractical but they still have the same structure of their DNA.   In comparison, wild animals can and will interbreed whenever they feel like it, and are not separated by people based on human preferences like domestic animals, so it's genetic compatibility and common survival traits that end up coalescing into common 'species' that either can't or don't interbreed (often).

Parrots and owls have evolved and been separate species for millions of years. They probably can\u2019t interbreed.  With that said, it still happens.

Often if two species can and do breed, Scientists start asking if they are actually different species at all, or variants of the same species. (This question has been debated about polar bears and grizzly bears, which do interbreed).  Edit: I refrained from too many terms at first, but it might be helpful- when we talk about hybrids, usually it is within the same *Genus*, or maybe the same *Family*. *sub species* are usually theoretically capable of breeding but are divided by other means- like location or behavior- becoming genetically distinct populations of the same *species*. To illustrate the evolutionary relationships between animals, scientists keep on sticking more names in between (*Subfamily* *Infraorder*) but there is no magical place to draw these lines- it\u2019s simply a way to say \u201cthis set of animals evolved from the same ancestor\u201d.

(It's also worth noting that many of the paintings involve subjects where this technique would be particularly effective, like shiny armour in a darkened room with a single 'spot' source of light. A renaissance artist's studio would have resembled a photographer's studio today)  On the other hand, Classical Art (and some Egyptian Art) made sculptures that are near perfect, and their mosaics are also close to realism, and that can't be explained with lenses.  I think it's clear that stylisation played a significant role: it wasn't just that people *couldn't* do 'realistic' (that is, as we know from photographs) portraits, it was that they weren't trying to. They were often aspiring to something else: to show the power of a ruler, to represent the Gods, to communicate something or exhibit a particular aesthetic sensibility. The Greek philosophy of art  (Plato and Aristotle) *did* expressly see mimeticism (looking-like-the-thing) as being the purpose or measure of good art though, which explains why Greek and Roman mosaics, sculptures, and sarcophagi paintings are as realistic as they are.": 0.0,
            "The purpose of art isn't always meant to be accurate and realistic. The Renaissance really saw the growth of art method and the adoption of styles that closer replicate real life, including professional studios and guilds, the use of models, perspective drawing, paints and oils, etc. There's a huge difference between the work from someone who is a full-time painter who learned his art from a master over many years, and a monk who spent years copying out the Bible and adding caricatures in the margins.": 1.0

The truth is that most things we do produce dangerous (often radioactive) waste. With nuclear, the waste are concentrated in very little mass, yes it seem dangerous but it's far easier to control and secure.

Context; my child has had all his vaccinations to date, but under our schedule that doesn\u2019t include the second mmr until age 4. Measles and mumps are having somewhat of an \u2018outbreak\u2019 here, but that\u2019s fewer than 100 cases in the last year countrywide.  Sorry if this isn\u2019t quite right for this sub, the issue is causing a rift in our family, and I really don\u2019t know what to do. I thought we were all safe, being vaccinated, but there\u2019s an argument being made that we don\u2019t know if the vaccinations worked, or if our son is \u2018safe\u2019 since he hasn\u2019t had the full schedule.  It also doesn\u2019t help that unvaccinated cousin is out and about a lot, and likely to travel soon.   I\u2019m hoping this sub might be able to give me a reasoned answer, without the political turmoil. Our family doctor said that in theory he\u2019s safe but \u2018I wouldn\u2019t personally allow my children to play with an unvaccinated child if I could help it\u2019, which just left me more confused than anything.\n### Comment:\n",

            "I think it helps if you understand what a Boggart is. Boggarts fit into the category of \u201cnon-being\u201d in the HP universe.

The most well known non-beings after the Boggarts are the Dementors, and once you know that you should start to see the similarities: both are beings that feed off emotions and have abilities designed to inflict the ones they want on their victims. A Dementor is a spirit of sadness and melancholy, which is why their presence makes people feel cold and upset. A Boggart, meanwhile, is a spirit of fear. Their main power is to take the form of a person\u2019s worst fear, and (according to the HP wiki) even when not observed they still take actions to instill fear like scratching walls and tapping on windows.   So what does a Boggart do once it\u2019s scared you? Nothing. It\u2019s already got what it wanted, your terrified reaction has \u201cfed\u201d it. My guess is it would probably leave, only to come back later when it got \u201chungry\u201d.": 1.0

            "Depends how much force and corresponding stress (force per area) you can generate within the material and if some kind of creep mechanism is possible under the conditions you have.   Up to a certain stress, the metal will behave *elastically* meaning it will be stretched but return to original length/shape when you remove the force. Above that particular stress, it will behave plastically meaning things called dislocations will be transported through the lattice structure in the metal causing the metal to not return to original shape when load is removed. (If it\u2019s brittle material the material will usually break before much plastic deformation occurs).  If the material is heated up you can get something called creep where the thing under stress would continue to elongate or deform under a constant stress as long as the creep mechanism has enough energy to activate (from the temp). I think at low temps the dominant mechanism would be grains sliding against each other.  Also I think magnetism decreases with temperature so might be hard to create conditions where you can creep some metal with a magnet.  So if you had a sample that melts close to room temperature and can exhibit magnetism, then you could probably continuously plastically deform that sample.": 0.0,
            "On a microscopic level over really long time, yes. Materials will creep over very long time periods, sped up by applied load and temperature. Basically a material that is far under the average load/temperature required to break bonds will still randomly have small random spikes of energy concentrations. Over long enough time these small energy spikes will eventually be energetic enough and happen in a weak point, so bonds can break. So, yes. The load applied by the magnet will influence and increase creep. But under normal temperatures and loads it will not make a noticeable difference on a macroscopic level.": 1.0

They hit a station, but no idea what station.   And they hear two people talking about an event.  When they get done talking, they identify themselves as KVHT 730 AM radio out of Bumblestan Michigan.   Well now you have some measure of trustworthiness to it, or the ability to find out.  (Is this a well respected local station, or the station always reporting we are about to be invaded by aliens)  And also, if you thought it was a good news program, you can make a point of trying to tune in again tomorrow now that you know what station you were listening to.  And so it makes sense for stations to identify themselves.  And not just at the end.  Most stations will try to identify themselves every 10 minutes or so.  This means during a 30 minute interview or 30 minute news program they find good breaks to identify themselves.  At the start and at the end are pretty good spots to use that don't break the flow of the show.

Is it ok to delay jabs until COVID-19 situation gets a bit more under control? Or better to just go?   Thank you in advance.\n### Comment:\n",

In theory it could run forever, since the code doesn't change.  Reason 1: You have a small bug. Every 1 million user registrations your user registration page breaks and needs to be restarted.  Reason 2: You don't actually handle money yourself. You have 15 different banks/companies in different countries that handle money transfers for you. Every 2-3 years they change something, due to laws in that country being changed. That means your site breaks, on average, 5 times per year.  Reason 3: The power went out. You need to push a button to start the site again.  Reason 4: Google changed their search algorithm again. If you don't provide \"the new data\" nobody will ever see your site again - it's now on page 2!!!  Reason 5: You site actually had a really really complicated security issue. Luckily somebody fixed the tools you're using for your website, but you still have to press the button to update. If you don't, in 3 months there'll be an easy-to-use app called \"site-breaker-kit\" that just takes over your website.": 0.0,

            "Average life expectancies for populations tend to get shorter the further into the past you go.  Of course, in the past, some people lived into their 80s, with evidence from places like ancient egypt (2400BCE),where the Egyptian Vizier Ptahhotep wrote verses about the disintegrations of old age, and Greece, where they classed old age among the divine curses, and their tombstones attest to survival well past 80 years. Ancient artworks and figurines also depict elderly people: stooped, flabby, wrinkled.  &#x200B;  https://www.sapiens.org/biology/human-lifespan-history/  &#x200B;  Concerning life expectancy, a variety of factors had an impact on the average age of a person  at death.  Almost half of all births ended in death before the age of 5, greatly lowering the average.  When infant mortality is removed, evidence seem to show averages of life expectancy for 3000 years ago to be around 52, give or take 15 years.  &#x200B;  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2625386/  &#x200B;  Can people live to 150?  Likely not.  Studies have shown that the estimated maximum of the human life span is around 125 years, under ideal conditions.  This maximum would have been the same in previous generations, though the life-expectancies of those generations were limited by conditions that were not ideal - lack of medicine, for example, famine, war, and so on.  &#x200B;  https://learn.age-up.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-human-longevity/  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-008-9156-4": 0.0,
            "Life expectancy is an average.   Let\u2019s say you have two people. One dies at 70 and the other dies before their 1st birthday. Their average life expectancy is 35. Lots of women died in child birth and the infant mortality rate was high. That\u2019s what skews the numbers  In this study,  they talk about how Ancient Greek and Roman men born before 100 BC had a median length of life of 72 years. Those born after 100 BC went down to 66 years. Probably because that\u2019s about the time they started using lead pipes.   So if you\u2019re asking if modern people are *physically capable* of living longer, I\u2019m gonna go with \u201cnot really.\u201d If ancient man had had access to antibiotics, blood transfusions, chemo etc\u2026.they would have lived longer too. Ancient people were capable of longer lives, they just didn\u2019t have the medicine to support it.

This is a really basic question for an engineering subreddit, but I didn\u2019t know where else to ask. What measurements are used to size nuts and bolts? I\u2019m looking to find a slightly shorter bolt than the one I have on hand for a project, but I don\u2019t know what sizes or measurements I need to know to get one. Can someone help a clueless guy here figure out how to size bolts? Thanks\n### Comment:\n",

The reality is, calling the cops and/or CPS on the other parent still puts you at risk, and you want to protect yourself.  Definitely start working on that custody order, and this is worthy of an interim custody order. A custody order can be more than who gets the child when, it can also explicitly order who can watch the child, what day care arrangements are required, etc. For example, his mom's judgement seriously should be questioned by the court that she didn't turn him in and that she thought it was OK.

Every time I look at getting into a relationship I can\u2019t honestly say I have the time that most people want. I don\u2019t work a 9-5. I work kind of insane hours. Also, I worry that any time I dedicate to a relationship is time I could be spending writing that next article or doing XYZ thing to advance my career.   Does it get better?  How do you all find/make the time? Do you feel like it takes away from your career?  Field: Engineering  Title: PhD student  Country:US\n### Comment:\n",

            "In general terms, animals with exoskeleton breathe by passive diffusion of oxygen via airways in their carapace - they don't have lungs. The less oxygen present in the atmosphere, the less it gets to the tissues that need it (pretty much all of them).  Therefore, the smaller the animal, the better oxygen reaches their whole body. This is why they can only grow up to a specific size.  Which means, we better keep oxygen as it is, otherwise,  we could be seeing stuff of nightmares - or extinct them.": 0.0,
            "Yes, generally speaking. Spiders (arachnids) and insects don't have lungs like you and I. The way spiders and insects breathe are slightly different, but in both cases they are limited by how much oxygen in the air is available.  For insects, they get oxygen through tiny holes in their bodies that are connected to a network of tubes. The tubes let the oxygen get into the rest of the bug, oxygen passes through the walls of the tubes, so the farther you get down the tube, the more oxygen has been taken out. More oxygen in the air lets it get further into the bug, meaning that the bug can be bigger and still get enough oxygen. Reduce the oxygen, and it can't reach as far into the bug, so the bug must be smaller to make sure that oxygen can get everywhere.  Spiders have what's called a \"book lung\" which has little flat sheets that look like the pages of a book, and each little sheet has blood (hemolymph) that circulates through it to carry oxygen away. This eliminates the network of tubes that insects have, but there's no muscles to expand and compress the lung to push air in and out like you or me. It still relies on air passively flowing through a few tiny holes in the abdomen that lead to book lung. Similar to the insects, the oxygen levels decrease from where it enters to the end of the \"pages\" in the lung. Increase the amount of oxygen, and the book lung could have longer pages and support a bigger spider; decrease the amount of oxygen, and longer pages can't get enough oxygen so the spider needs to be smaller.  Most insects' and most spiders' sizes are not limited only by oxygen, but also by their body shape. The way they breathe sets something of an upper limit to their size based on available oxygen, but all of them are below that limit.": 1.0

At high enough levels, the sugar will draw water out of bacteria into the sugar/water via osmosis making them inert and incapable of growing or reproducing.   With a 1:1 simple syrup, the concentration of sugar isn\u2019t high enough to cause the osmosis and prohibit bacterial growth so it isn\u2019t really acting as a preservative. It can last about 3-4 weeks though if stored in a sterile container in the fridge.   But you can make a simple syrup with a longer shelf life by increasing the sugar concentration and making a syrup with a 2:1 sugar to water ratio. This is strong enough that the sugar will act as a preservative and prohibit bacterial growth and can last a few months  under the same conditions.

            "Three things to remember about what Tony Stark did in that cave with that box of scraps:  1. The \"scraps\" were from state-of-the-art military hardware produced by Stark Industries.  So this is cutting-edge stuff that's only jumbled together because no one else around knows what it is or how it works.  2. His life was in immediate danger from shrapnel that was barely held under control by a heavy, undependable battery, so his life literally depended on producing a better power supply.  3. He was being held prisoner in that cave by terrorists who'd threatened to kill him if he didn't produce some results, which is a powerful motivator.  4. There's no indication he had anything else to do but tinker with those parts and try to invent something.    So you've got a mentally unstable genius engineer who has nothing to do but engineer, and who will die if he doesn't, provided with an assortment of high-tech parts whose true capabilities no one around but him actually knows.    Back at Stark Industries, you've got a bunch of people with the parts and the specs and maybe the brains, but miniaturizing the Arc Reactor for them would be a cool thing they might could do someday that would get them a big bonus.  Their **lives** don't depend on pulling it off and doing so ***right now***.": 0.0,
            "In 1800AD a man named Alessandro Volta invented the first battery. It was made by stacking pairs of copper and zinc disks separated by brine soaked cloth. It was revolutionary for the fact that it produced a stable, continuous current, and retained it's charged rather well when not being used. However, it didn't even produce a strong enough charge to create sparks. On top of that, Volta had a flawed understanding of how his own battery worked, assuming that the current was a result of two different materials coming into contact with one another. The true nature of the current was in the chemical reaction that was being produced.      The full sized arc reactor is Volta's battery, flawed scientific theories included.      Tony Stark's miniature reactor is a Lithium-Ion battery whose thickness is measured in millimeters, weighs less than a slice of bread, can fully power a handheld computer for half a day, can recover that charge in an hour, and can be recharged well over 300 times before losing it's efficiency.      Stark's miniature arc reactor is so far ahead of the original, both in design and in supporting scientific theory, that the two simply can't be compared. Trying to recreate Stark's achievement by studying the full sized reactor would be like trying to build an Oculus Rift by studying a CRT TV. They are generations apart from each other.": 1.0

My six year old walking around in shorts, shirtless, wiping his forehead and going \u201cwhew it\u2019s hot\u201d, and it\u2019s 60\u00b0F in my house and we\u2019re running the heater. Meanwhile when we hit 110\u00b0F this summer he was bundling up under blankets and long sleeved shirts saying how cold he was.   Is he just being a weird six year old (because let\u2019s be honest, they\u2019re all weird at six) or is there something I should be looking into here?  We have suspicion he\u2019s on the spectrum but the psychiatrist we saw wouldn\u2019t even test him for it, just had a conversation with us as parents where he happened to be in the room. Otherwise a generally healthy kid (aside from a tonsillectomy for apnea) with no major outstanding conditions (that we know of).\n### Comment:\n",

Depression/anxiety is a great example (and you see a lot of TV ads for those products). If you let people know thru TV that there's a drug that might help them, they're much more likely to actually bring it up with their doctor. Another more trivial example: Erectile Dysfunction.

            "In many restaurants its not a quantified scale (ie its not how many chillis or spoonfuls of spice are added), but relates to a qualitative scale.   1 usually means \"not spicy for folk who like spice, mild enough for folk who don't enjoy heat to say that its nicely spiced\".  2 usually means \"hot enough that someone who doesn't enjoy heat is going to struggle a bit with it, but could just manage\".  3 is \"hot enough for someone who enjoys a bit of spice, but isn't crazy about burning their mouth off\"  4 is \"too hot for most people, but not quite as hot as the dish can reasonably be made\"  5 is \"about as hot as the dish can reasonably be made without ruining it\".   It'll vary from dish to dish, as some flavour profiles can take more spice.   Of course, they'll absolutely make any dish spicier than a 5 for you if you ask, but at that point you're just trading away flavour for heat.": 0.0,
            "Hi I am a Thai chef and can probably answer this question decently. In your run of the mill restaurant it is likely just how much dried pepper they use which is a damn shame. I eat hot food but some places will ruin a dish by just making it dry with the amount of pepper flakes they put on it. Truthfully, you can almost always order a 3 or 2 and it will be fine. Not disgustingly unbalanced but also not missing the heat. Now for the more detailed answer.   In thai food they don't use chili oil very often. It exists as a product of China but they don't use it nearly at all. Some regional foods are hotter than others and it can determine which type of chili is used. Some use dried, some use less spicy but fresh peppers. Eastern Thai (also called Issan Thai) is the hottest regional cuisine but northern Thai is genrally not that spicy by comparison. I don't believe in artificially scaling heat.  Thai food is all about balance of flavor with heat being a key component. Not all thai food it naturally hot. Some is disturbingly spicy. Next time you go to your local spot, don't order pad thai or massaman curry or something normal like that. Instead try something like;  Laap/Larb/Laab/Meat Salad with stick rice Kra Prao (or something pronounced like kapow) Or my favorite, Khao Soi  Laap is a mixed bag on how its made but when done well, it's the absolute best.  Edit; I'm glad this helped lots of people it seems. I love Thai food and think we only scratch the surface of it in the US so the more i can do to share my interest the better. Feel free to DM me if you have questions.": 1.0

With the cigarette example you used, let\u2019s say someone\u2019s house burned. Patterns indicate it started in their living room and the worst damage was in the area of the remnants of a chair. We\u2019d dig that area out and look for sources of ignition such as electronics. If none are found we\u2019d assume it was a different source. We would interview the residents and if they said a certain person always sat in that chair we\u2019d ask more questions. Let\u2019s just say they say he sat there and smoked a lot and was even sitting there an hour before the fire started.  So what we couldn\u2019t say for certain is that the fire started in that chair and was for sure caused by the resident smoking. What we can say is the fire started at or near the chair, that no ignition sources such as electronics were in that area, and the fire was most likely caused by another ignition source. We can take samples to be tested for accelerants as well but if those aren\u2019t present what\u2019s the most likely cause?

            "First of all, letters aren\u2019t vowels. Some speech sounds are vowels. What letters or other signs represent what sounds depends very much on the language, the writing system and the accent of the speaker. That said, there are two definitions of a vowel. One is phonetic - a vowel is a sound produced without any constriction anywhere in the vocal tract, letting the air escape without obstruction. Another is phonological - a vowel is the central part (the \u201cpeak\u201d) of a syllable. These definitions contradict sometimes. For example, \u201cy\u201d in \u201cyet\u201d represents a (phonetic) vowel, but it\u2019s not the peak of the syllable. Another example: in some languages an r-like sound can form the central part of a syllable, making it a vowel phonologically, but it\u2019s decidedly not a phonetic vowel.": 0.0,
            "A vowel is essentially a letter sound that is generated without constricting the airflow in your throat -- compared to a consonant which involves manipulating or constricting the air in some way. Think of the three sounds that go into the word \"Cat\".  You have the C/K sound + the \"a\" sound + plus the hard T sound.    Say the word slowly -- notice how in the K sound, you have to push a short burst of air over your tongue to the top of your mouth -- in the T sound you do something similar, pushing the air between your tongue and your teeth.  The \"a\" sound on the other hand, has a nice open mouth and unrestricted airflow in your throat.  That's a vowel.  Notice how much easier and natural it is to hold that \"a\" sound for a long time compared to the K/T.  Vowels are consistent in that basically all languages have them, because they give your throat and airflow a break from the \"work\" required in a consonant.  But how the vowels sound, how many there are, and how frequently they are used do vary wildly -- English has just 6 vowel letters, but those letters can make around a dozen different vowel sounds (think of the a in \"apple\" vs \"cape\").  Spanish, on the other hand, has just 5 vowel letters and each letter makes a more-or-less consistent sound.": 1.0

A trap is added to his chest plate, allowing him to hold the ghost steady and capture it directly.   Phase 2: Tony massively strengthens the proton pack, meaning the ghost is held fast, unable to move or fight against the beam. The chest trap is increased in power and range. Sensors have been upgraded to detect PK energy.   Phase 3: The beam is further strengthened and the containment field imroved, so it is less wavy and more direct, making it easier to aim. As the beam works by dissipating psychokinetic (PK) energy which ghosts use to manifest themselves, some weaker ghosts are now 'dissolved' by a simple blast from the beam. Larger and stronger ghosts are weakened to the point where they are immediately helpless and easily trapped. The chest trap now can capture multiple ghosts, storing them in a secondary unit, allowing for fast containment of large numbers of ghosts.   Phase 4: The beam and containment are now combined, leading to weaker ghosts being destroyed and stronger ones being caught and dragged into the suit in a single shot. the suit now taps into PK energy as a secondary power source, meaning that the heads up display can show real time PK energy and movement, allowing Tony to see the spirit world and track ghosts over long range.   Phase 5: Wide scale PK tracking now allows for trapper drones to quickly reach hot spots and remove ghost activity before it reaches any kind of level where ghosts are able to manifest. The few that do Tony can track and reach immediately. Tony has upgraded the traps to allow for cross dimensional storage, meaning that ghosts who are caught get transferred into storage right away and he never needs to empty the \"trap\".": 1.0

Your body\u2019s balance begins in the feet; when the feet do not provide proper support, it can raise your risk for joint problems caused by poor posture and unnatural gait. Individuals with flat feet could be more likely to experience injury or pain in the feet, ankles, knees, or hips. A condition called plantar fasciitis is more common in people with flat feet as well. Plantar fasciitis occurs when the tendons in the feet are overstretched. This condition causes severe pain in the feet, especially in the morning.  Flat feet tend to cause another condition called overpronation, which is when the ankles roll inward while you\u2019re walking. This can lead to foot and ankle pain.

Sitting on the edge of the car at the center of the road results in you seeing longer past a vehicle in front of you. You alos need to expose less of the car to oncoming traffic before not traffic is blocked by the vehicle in front.  It might not be that relevant if you overtake a car but if it is a truck it will block a lot ahead.  Sitting in the middle of the car gives you the same amount of visibility towards both sides but I am not sure that is a huge advantage. If you drive a car having better visibility on toward the center of the road is in my experience better.  There is a lot more situation when you car what is on that side of the car directly beside, behind, or in front compared to the other side.   Regardless of the visibility, the main reason is what is mentioned in other posts, you fit two individuals in the front row of a car.   There is one problem with this argument, trucks and other larger vehicles. They are also controlled from one side even when they are and have three sets side by side.

My grandmother passed back in 2012 and has been receiving roughly $100 a month from Fidelity for a retirement account through her job. The account it was going to had my mom and grandmother's name both on it. My mother nev we informed Fidelity she had passed, so they kept sending the money.

Instead of hearing a soundwave with twice as much energy as twice as loud, we hear it something like .3 (the result of log10(2)) times as loud (the actual value may be from a different log base in practice, but the scale is similar enough). This is far more useful to us, because now we can hear small sounds (like an animal walking in a forest) while not instantly being deafened by loud sounds (like an animal roaring to scare away predators).  There is also a potential of the energy being less based on distance (sound becomes less energetic at a cube rate of distance from the source), but that is the lesser influence in a single venue. It is also possible to have constructive/destructive soundwaves, but the chaos of a choir arrangement is not precise enough to cancel out the energy involved at any real rate in either direction; that is something more often seen with precisely placed and timed electronic systems.": 0.0,

At a given moment in time some of their sound interferes destructively and cancels out. Doubling random, weakly correlated sounds adds 3 dB to the power. So you would get about 20 dB increase from 1 to 100.  Human hearing is also non-linear, and adapts to louder noises by becoming less sensitive. In practice it is not that important to tell 99 and 100 sources of sound apart. You just need to know there is \"a lot\". An increase of 8 to 10 dB is perceived to be twice as loud.": 1.0

Due to the fact that my country has a somewhat messy academic system, I found myself working on project A (one area within my discipline) and project B (another area within my discipline) for financial reasons, while trying to conduct my own PhD-thesis related research (let's call this \"project C\" - again, another area within my discipline). The situation becomes even more complicated because of additional random collaborations and because I also work on some extra stuff with my academic advisor (this stuff is a bit closer to my PhD-thesis than other projects).  So ... How bad is it to be a \"Jack of all trades\" in academia? Does it look a bit better if you are only the first author of publications that are close to your area of interest (and a middle author on other publications)? Can it even be advantageous to be a \"generalist\"? What would you suggest?\n### Comment:\n",

            "The expected number of \"wins\" in either case is the same: 0.7. But they're distributed differently, so the chance of **at least one** win is different.  The reason is that your ten 7% chances includes the possibility of *multiple* wins. To get the same average number of wins, those multiple wins have to also be balanced out by a higher chance of zero wins.  -----  More mathematically, the chance of zero wins here is the chance of not winning at each step, multiplied together. So for your 10 7% chances, your chance of not winning is 93% (that is, 1 - 0.07), and you end up with (1 - 0.07) \\* (1 - 0.07) \\* ... \\* (1 - 0.07) ten times. That comes out to (1 - 0.07)^10 = (0.93)^10 = about 0.48, or 48%.  It may help to think of things in smaller, easier to intuit numbers. How about one 100% chance and two 50% chances? Obviously two coin flips can come up both tails, so the two must be different, and it's worth actually listing out every option to see why. The single 100% chance has only one option: \"win\". The two 50% chances have four equally likely options: \"win win\", \"win lose\", \"lose win\", and \"lose lose\". In both cases, you average exactly one win, but in the second, the \"win win\" case gets balanced out by a \"lose lose\" one.": 0.0,

            "There's a couple things here.  First, SMS isn't end-to-end encrypted, but it is encrypted over-the-air. An attacker with radio can't just intercept your SMS messages. It can be intercepted by your carrier, someone who's hacked the carrier, or someone using a stingray (eg: the police) who's convinced your phone to connect.  Second, \"2FA\" literally means \"second factor authentication\" -- there's already been another factor used to initiate this action, which is usually a username+password.  This means to successfully attack a user's account on a service using 2FA:  1. The attacker needs to know the username and password 2. The attacker has to have inside access to the carrier's network equipment OR the attacker has to have a stingray and be nearby to have your phone connect to it  This significantly reduces the chance of a successful attack.  The real problem with SMS 2FA:  * SIM swaps are too easy -- this is where someone basically steals your phone number by pretending to be you and getting the number transferred to their own device. Sometimes this is social engineering, sometimes it's via an insider working for the phone company, sometimes it's hacking the carrier. * Too many places don't actually use this as a \"second\" factor, especially for password resets. The most common exploit is an attacker starts a password reset request, verifies the SMS (usually via SIM swap but could also be another hack), and then sets the password to whatever they want, and now own the account. In the case of an account take-over, they'll change the SMS and/or email address to ones they control and you're totally locked out.": 0.0,
            "As mentioned in another comment, SMS isn\u2019t as secure as a dedicated authenticator app. But it has a couple of advantages.    - Not everyone has a smart phone and so can\u2019t install a dedicated app.    - Authenticator apps can be a pain when you move to a new device. Some will transfer over, others may not. SMS doesn\u2019t have this problem.     - Almost everyone knows how SMS works, authenticator apps are a bit more complex. Less technically minded people may have trouble installing, setting up, and transferring codes.    - Even with SMS being less secure, it\u2019s still more secure than nothing at all. Every extra layer or step the attacker has to go through decreases your chance of getting compromised. It\u2019s just not the best step to take.": 1.0

I cant put it in the fridge immediately because its still hot and will fuck up the fridge.  Whats the right way to do this?",

            "Short answer: Because we figured out how.   Cooking meat allows us to extract about 15% more calories from it because of the denatured proteins. Similar for being able to mechanically digest it.   So ground beef that's been cooked to medium has about 25% more effective calories than the same weight of uncooked roast.   That lets humans be the efficient ape. Compared to Chimps (our closest relatives), we've got about the same amount of gut and about half as much jaw for twice the ape.   Cooking food kicks ass.   And this is even skipping over the huge gains that we get from our ability to take \"questionable\" (read, not really questionable, but almost certainly full of Trichinosis) meat and make it fully safe by sitting it over a smoky fire for a few hours.   Really, it may not be necessary to cook your meat, but it's so much better that it's no wonder the thermivore ape kicked the ever loving shit out of the omnivore apes when it came to competition for environment suitable for living/fucking/fighting.": 1.0

            "If you\u2019re rolling the dice properly, it doesn\u2019t matter and it\u2019s just tradition. But, it\u2019s theoretically possible to hold and throw the dice in a particular way and have certain faces come up more often, or to have slight manufacturing defects that cause one half to come up a bit more often. It\u2019s more of a thing with 20 sided or larger, more round, dice, but it\u2019s basically impossible to hit one face in particular. So, if you have 20, 19, 18, 17 and so on all right next to each other, someone could roll it in such a way that that general half of the dice comes up more often. Scattering the numbers so the high and low numbers are evenly dispersed compensates for that possibility.    I.e. if you have a 6 sided dice, you could theoretically roll it like a wheel so it\u2019s just rolling on 4 of the sides, and the other 2 will basically never be landed on. But you can\u2019t control which of the 4 it lands on. If you put the numbers so the 2 impossible sides are 1 and 2, you can get an unfair advantage, but if they are 1 and 6, or 2 and 5, you\u2019re eliminating both good and bad outcomes, not just bad ones, and you don\u2019t really benefit from rolling it that way. It\u2019s a pretty easily detectable method of cheating at dice, and pretty hard to execute, but it is possible, and placing the numbers the way they do helps to counter it.   Or there\u2019s a bubble in the resin that makes one half of the dice more likely to come up. If all the high numbers are on that half, it could be considered loaded and cheating. If there\u2019s high and low numbers on that half equally, there\u2019s an increased chance of both the good and bad numbers, so it\u2019s not as advantageous to the roller.": 1.0
