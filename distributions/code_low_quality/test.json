His assistant had to write down all temperatures into his notebook, but (for unknown reasons) he recorded only m.\n\n\n\nThe next day, the engineer's assistant filed in a report with all the m temperatures. However, the chief engineer doubts that the assistant wrote down everything correctly (naturally, the chief engineer doesn't doubt his notes). So he asked you to help him. Given numbers n, m, min, max and the list of m temperatures determine whether you can upgrade the set of m temperatures to the set of n temperatures (that is add n - m temperatures), so that the minimum temperature was min and the maximum one was max.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line contains four integers n, m, min, max (1 \u2264 m < n \u2264 100;\u00a01 \u2264 min < max \u2264 100). The second line contains m space-separated integers t_{i} (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 100) \u2014 the temperatures reported by the assistant.\n\n\n\nNote, that the reported temperatures, and the temperatures you want to add can contain equal temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nIf the data is consistent, print 'Correct' (without the quotes). Otherwise, print 'Incorrect' (without the quotes).\n\n### Response:\n",

He decided to reorder all elements in increasing order. Ivan loves merge sort so he decided to represent his array with one or several increasing sequences which he then plans to merge into one sorted array.\n\n\n\nIvan represent his array with increasing sequences with help of the following algorithm.\n\n\n\nWhile there is at least one unused number in array Ivan repeats the following procedure:  iterate through array from the left to the right;  Ivan only looks at unused numbers on current iteration;  if current number is the first unused number on this iteration or this number is greater than previous unused number on current iteration, then Ivan marks the number as used and writes it down. \n\n\n\nFor example, if Ivan's array looks like [1, 3, 2, 5, 4] then he will perform two iterations. On first iteration Ivan will use and write numbers [1, 3, 5], and on second one \u2014 [2, 4].\n\n\n\nWrite a program which helps Ivan and finds representation of the given array with one or several increasing sequences in accordance with algorithm described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of elements in Ivan's array.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains a sequence consisting of distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9) \u2014 Ivan's array.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint representation of the given array in the form of one or more increasing sequences in accordance with the algorithm described above. Each sequence must be printed on a new line.\n\n### Response:\n",

Each computer contains exactly one piece of information, each of which Doc wants to get eventually. The computers are equipped with a security system, so to crack the i-th of them, the robot needs to collect at least a_{i} any pieces of information from the other computers. Doc can hack the computer only if he is right next to it.\n\n\n\nThe robot is assembled using modern technologies and can move along the line of computers in either of the two possible directions, but the change of direction requires a large amount of resources from Doc. Tell the minimum number of changes of direction, which the robot will have to make to collect all n parts of information if initially it is next to computer with number 1.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that there exists at least one sequence of the robot's actions, which leads to the collection of all information.

Complete the request to the best of your ability.\n\n### Instruction:\nWrite a python program that is as close to a valid solution of the following python program as possible.\n\n### Input:\nWe saw the little game Marmot made for Mole's lunch. Now it's Marmot's dinner time and, as we all know, Marmot eats flowers. At every dinner he eats some red and white flowers. Therefore a dinner can be represented as a sequence of several flowers, some of them white and some of them red.\n\n\n\nBut, for a dinner to be tasty, there is a rule: Marmot wants to eat white flowers only in groups of size k.\n\n\n\nNow Marmot wonders in how many ways he can eat between a and b flowers. As the number of ways could be very large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nInput contains several test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line contains two integers t and k (1 \u2264 t, k \u2264 10^5), where t represents the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe next t lines contain two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 b_{i} \u2264 10^5), describing the i-th test.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint t lines to the standard output.
