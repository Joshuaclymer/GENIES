            "Really as an adult we \"forget\" how to fall asleep. The trick really is to clear your mind and relax. This used to come naturally when you were younger, but now you have the stresses of being older which make it harder to relax and let go of.     If it helps I have some tricks on how to get to sleep easier. The big trick I've found is you need to \"practice\" going to sleep. When you go and lie down in bed, don't do anything else. Don't lie there and reflect on the day's events, don't read a book, and certainly don't look at your phone or TV. Remove those from the room if possible. Get in the habit of bedtime is sleep only. If you lie down on your bed you only sleep. You have to be strict with yourself. Next is a sort of form of self hypnosis. When you lie down to go to bed, think of a trigger phrase. Something pleasant, but which you wouldn't say normally. Good night sweetie to yourself or something. Whatever it is just make sure it is unique and pleasant. This becomes a sort of hypnotic trigger which will tell your mind know you are trying to sleep. Finally relax. Flex and release your body muscles starting at your head and going all the way down to your toes. This will help you relax and fall asleep. Most important though, clear your mind, if you start thinking of something catch yourself and clear your mind again. Eventually this will become habit and you should be able to just fall right asleep.": 1.0

            "While we're here talking about kosher salt, I was wondering if someone could do me a massive favour.  Some American recipes give volume amounts of kosher salt like this recipe from BA. They give 5 tsp of Diamond Crystal brand, or 1 tbsp of Morton brand.  This is useless for me as someone who doesn't have access to kosher salt. I know it won't make a massive difference, but it would be nice to know.  Could someone weigh like a tablespoon of either brand and tell me how much it weighs, just so I can compare it to my salt?  Edit: Thanks. I've had lots of answers with quite a bit of variation (that's why weight is better than cups and spoons). The general consensus seems to be that Morton weighs about 1.05 times its volume (with grams and millilitres). So a tbsp (15ml) is about 15.75g although I've had weights as low as 14g and as high as 17.5g.  Fewer people had diamond crystal but it seems to be about 0.75 times its volume. So a tbsp is like 11.5g. But some people said 9g so who knows?  Conclusion: weigh things! (If you're baking and want to be precise)": 1.0

With the speed of CPUs and the power of networking now, there is a new breed of aimbot which runs on a 2nd computer.  You run a video feed out of your machine into the 2nd PC.  You use a program to do neural net learning to train the other what is a target vs not and how to aim.  You then run an output from that CPU via USB into your gaming PC as a USB device which send mouse inputs.  This makes it look like nothing more than mouse input.  Since the CPU is responding realtime to what it sees, your movements + the other CPU's movements work in unison, like you have a magnet always pulling your mouse to specific locations, but since it isn't using objects like injection does, it will not snap through walls.  When the 2nd CPU 'sees' what would appear to be a valid target, then the CPU sends the mouse movements which are mixed with your for a very organic mouse movement.

This usually takes a while and by the time other ingredients are finished, the garlic will have burned, so it's practical to toss the garlic in later on in the process.  However, with a lot of stir frying, the ingredients are often already par-cooked or cut into very small or thin pieces to cook incredibly quickly. The garlic and ginger are meant to infuse the oil with flavor before other ingredients are tossed in to heat up and coat in the aromatic oils. Because they cook for so little time, you want the oil to already be very infused with the aromatics, so the ginger and garlic go in first.

            "One potential answer is lenses.  The technology to make high quality lenses first emerges in Holland and Italy during the 15th century. These allowed artists to project images of a sitter onto a canvas and to sketch the main lines and shades, giving the hyperrealistic paintings the renaissance became famous for. (It's also worth noting that many of the paintings involve subjects where this technique would be particularly effective, like shiny armour in a darkened room with a single 'spot' source of light. A renaissance artist's studio would have resembled a photographer's studio today)  On the other hand, Classical Art (and some Egyptian Art) made sculptures that are near perfect, and their mosaics are also close to realism, and that can't be explained with lenses.  I think it's clear that stylisation played a significant role: it wasn't just that people *couldn't* do 'realistic' (that is, as we know from photographs) portraits, it was that they weren't trying to. They were often aspiring to something else: to show the power of a ruler, to represent the Gods, to communicate something or exhibit a particular aesthetic sensibility. The Greek philosophy of art  (Plato and Aristotle) *did* expressly see mimeticism (looking-like-the-thing) as being the purpose or measure of good art though, which explains why Greek and Roman mosaics, sculptures, and sarcophagi paintings are as realistic as they are.": 1.0

We know this because everything with \"cold blood\" does so for literally 10% of the cost (normalized for body weight and temperature).  Where do the other 90% of our baseline calories go?  Heat.  Specifically, we poke holes in the membranes of our mitochondria (via uncoupling proteins) to make them less efficient.  This means we burn more energy to get the same ATP (cellular energy molecule), the rest of which is heat.  This, in turn, heats our body and lets us be \"warm blooded\", at tremendous metabolic cost.  To get warmer, we simply increase the number of these proteins.  There's also diet drugs that do this, but they're incredibly dangerous because you can't plug the holes once they're made, you just have to wait for the proteins to break down.  Incidentally \"cold blooded\" species can get fevers too - pyrogens prompt them to bask more and get to hotter temperatures, a sort of \"behavioral fever\".  For pendants, note the quotes around \"warm blooded\" and \"cold blooded\".": 1.0

        "post_content": "CMV: Hand washing facilities should be placed outside of bathrooms rather than inside. Washing your hands after going to the toilet is obviously a good thing to do. The problem, as I see it, is that this relies on everyone washing their hands (which we know isn\u2019t the case). If there is an inward opening door, you have to make contact with the handle which is touched by everyone else.   Also, unless the stalls are completely sealed, it seems that fecal particles can disperse through a room, meaning that the taps(faucets) and any other surfaces are compromised.   It makes more sense to me that we wash our hands once we leave the bathroom so that we sanitise once we no longer have to contact shared handles or objects that share a space with toilets. It would incentivise the non-washers to wash because it\u2019s more likely the handle will be compromised if no one has washed their hands before exit.   The ideal solution, in my opinion, would be to have hand washing facilities both inside and out as we may also use the sinks and mirrors inside the bathroom to shave, apply make up and have the option to double wash.   I\u2019m struggling to find any downside outside of the financial and architectural inconvenience. I don\u2019t really think they are significant enough to prohibit this, as we accept these for other things when the inconvenience is outweighed by the benefit.   Change my view!",

            "I saw one bathroom, in Phoenix, AZ. You walked in with no door and there was a wall of sinks, and that's where the door was to each bathroom! So the sink washing area was unisex and didn't require a door to leave. It was weird when I first walked into the bathroom and saw a woman washing her hands and I thought I walked into the wrong one, but then I realized I hadn't walked into the actual bathroom yet. Great design, and kinda halfway to your suggestion.": 1.0

Washing your hands after going to the toilet is obviously a good thing to do. The problem, as I see it, is that this relies on everyone washing their hands (which we know isn\u2019t the case). If there is an inward opening door, you have to make contact with the handle which is touched by everyone else.   Also, unless the stalls are completely sealed, it seems that fecal particles can disperse through a room, meaning that the taps(faucets) and any other surfaces are compromised.   It makes more sense to me that we wash our hands once we leave the bathroom so that we sanitise once we no longer have to contact shared handles or objects that share a space with toilets. It would incentivise the non-washers to wash because it\u2019s more likely the handle will be compromised if no one has washed their hands before exit.   The ideal solution, in my opinion, would be to have hand washing facilities both inside and out as we may also use the sinks and mirrors inside the bathroom to shave, apply make up and have the option to double wash.   I\u2019m struggling to find any downside outside of the financial and architectural inconvenience. I don\u2019t really think they are significant enough to prohibit this, as we accept these for other things when the inconvenience is outweighed by the benefit.   Change my view!\n### Comment:\n",

            "I might get down voted to hell for this, but it is 100% a case of 'we want gender equality when it suits us'. Logically there is no reason why a woman is worse at chess. A woman can be number one if she is good enough. Less women play chess though, and a smaller pool produces less top tier players, so they get their own special pool. It is basically because 'best female player in the world' sounds better than '65th best player in the world'. I am sure it is great for the females in question (actually Polgar was 8th in the world, very impressive)\u2026 but no one seems to care about the guy at 64th who is lost to obscurity having worked very hard to reach that level, while the person OBJECTIVELY worse at the sport than him gets fame and called number one and wins their own special prize pool for beating people ranked lower than her.   That is a pretty huge equality issue right there for me. If two people work hard to be top tier in the world, and one is better than the other\u2026 The underdog shouldn't be lauded over/get more attention/ another prize pool just because of gender WHATEVER way round it is.  Equality works both ways, but trying to tell anyone that 100% always makes you come across as a sexist douche. It is not my intention and I am sorry.": 1.0

These libraries are constantly being updated for new features, security risks, stability etc.    That means you need to frequently update your app to at the very least use the new libraries.  Not doing so won't break it right away, but sooner or later (hint: usually sooner) there will be a breaking change such as an older version being deprecated, or a field name being changed, that requires you to not only update the library you tell your program to use, but to make some changes internally as well.

In theory it could run forever, since the code doesn't change.  Reason 1: You have a small bug. Every 1 million user registrations your user registration page breaks and needs to be restarted.  Reason 2: You don't actually handle money yourself. You have 15 different banks/companies in different countries that handle money transfers for you. Every 2-3 years they change something, due to laws in that country being changed. That means your site breaks, on average, 5 times per year.  Reason 3: The power went out. You need to push a button to start the site again.  Reason 4: Google changed their search algorithm again. If you don't provide \"the new data\" nobody will ever see your site again - it's now on page 2!!!  Reason 5: You site actually had a really really complicated security issue. Luckily somebody fixed the tools you're using for your website, but you still have to press the button to update. If you don't, in 3 months there'll be an easy-to-use app called \"site-breaker-kit\" that just takes over your website.": 1.0

I complied, stepped out and locked the door behind me, as soon as they saw me they walked away.  My question is that, is this considered harassment from my Landlord?

            "To build upon what others have said regarding AM and FM, as many have pointed out, the AM *broadcast band* is very low frequency and thus long wavelength, while the FM *broadcast band* is comparatively high frequency and short wavelength.  A typical FM antenna is a single element that is several feet or perhaps tens of feet long, typically mounted on top of a long tower and often on a hill.  With AM on the other hand, the actual tower itself is the antenna, typically many tens of feet tall, along with lots of cables buried underground coming out radially from the mast(s).  If you're driving around and you see several tall towers near each other, in a line, box, or cross type formation, often with little to nothing mounted on the towers, it's a good chance you're seeing an AM station.  The shape of the tower layout is often used to direct which way the signal goes, and electronics will often turn the various towers \"on or off\" (or adjust phase) as the sun rises/sets to change the power or radiation shape.  Finally broadcast AM is typically super efficient compared to FM; a 5kw AM transmitter could reasonably cover the same area as a 50kw FM broadcast transmitter.": 1.0

Likely department policy gave individual members a choice as to what they packed, and Rick opted for the revolver.  First, a double-action revolver allows a balance of speed and safety when being brought into use. In particular, the \"pull weight\" (the amount of force that needs to be applied to the trigger to fire the weapon) acts as a safety against premature or negligent discharge of the weapon, reducing the need for other safety devices which could complicate operation, slow deployment of the weapon, or even jam up and fail to disengage at the moment of truth.  Second, a big hollow point 357 Magnum round is enough firepower to deal with wild animals without being excessive to discharge in an urban environment; it's a bit overkill for a person, but a perfectly reasonable amount of kill if someone calls in a bear roaming around the neighborhood.  Third, for guys who started on a revolver it's often easier to stick with a revolver.

I'm beginning to think that what people actually dislike is not twitter, but people with differing viewpoints. Whenever discussions about twitter comes up, people seem to absolutely hate that site. And yet, there are several tweets on the front page right now, not to mention the subreddits specifically about posting twitter screenshots. I don't use twitter frequently, so I'm confused about what people on reddit mean when they say twitter is awful. Sure, it's possible that there's two different groups of people who like or dislike twitter, but then you'd think only one of either criticisms of twitter or twitter screenshots would be highly upvoted, not both.

            "Some plants have different responses to interpreting or Inbreeding. Some plants can self pollinate as well. It is easily confirmed that interbreeding of some plant species can result in the passing down of traits that will eventually be either beneficial and continue on or they will be a hindrance that eventually dies out. In the world of cannabis, a self pollinated plant will have to be carrying hermaphrodite genes and will almost assuredly pass those down to its offspring. This can be a problem for commercial growers who need to avoid having seeds appear in a female crop, but it can be a benefit for a home grower who likes to propagate from seeds. In nature it would self sustain  for a time before eventually having new genetics introduced when a new plant is available for breeding, and then the hermaphrodite genes would slowly phase out over many generations. Plants with wider genetic variation in their offspring, like some Mangoes and Apples that can self pollinate, will generally have an entirely new cultivar come from their seeds. My mulberry tree (which can self pollinate for fruit production but has incredible low seed viability from self pollination), died recently. A bird which ate the fruit off of it had pooped in one of my other potted plants, and behold, I now have a 3 ft tall mulberry sapling. Whether it yields viable fruit or not is still to be seen, but life...uh, finds a way.   Some plants are meant to self pollinate so its genetics may survive a less favorable season and come back the next year to try again, some require an entirely different cultivar to pollinate them. Plants are complex and have multiple methods of reproduction. So long story short, yes they can inbreed. Some are meant to, some aren't. Some develop mutations, some don't.": 1.0

This surgery was not required, the Dr. said, but recommended because the shape of my wife's uterus could cause complications in child birth. My wife had the surgery done in Feb. 2022, performed by the fertility Dr.  Fast forward nine months later to today. We have spent an additional \\~$20k on the IVF process. It came time to implant the embryos and the Dr. just informed us that the surgery she performed correcting the shape of my wife's uterus didn't completely fix it and she needs to do it again. She now wants to charge us to do the surgery again is not willing to move forward with the IVF process until it is done.  The Dr. wants to do the surgery at a surgery center where we would have to pay cash. The surgery would not be covered by insurance at this surgery center. We keep trying to get the surgery scheduled at a hospital so insurance will cover it, but the Dr. is making that difficult. She really wants to do it at this surgery center where we will have to pay cash.   In my opinion, the Dr. should do the surgery for free. We already paid to have it done once, she didn't do it correctly, and now we're being held in a position where the $20k we've spent so far goes to nothing if we don't pay the Dr. again to do the surgery.  Do I have any recourse here?\n### Comment:\n",

Think about it, aside from maybe one egg, the ingredients are oil and some spices, and some acid.  None of these encourage growth, and the danger of salmonella contamination is in the bacteria multiplying.  Please treat this as anecdotal, as I can't find the reference where  I read it, but the whole reputation for bad mayonnaise comes from summer salads.  Even if there is a little salmonella in the mayo (and as I said, unlikely) it's not going to make anyone sick.  You can leave the mayo on the counter all day.  But...

The very next day, she calls my wife stating that she has covid and has to quarantine so she may need to be there until about the 20th, stating the moving men can't get her stuff out of the house and into her new condo because of it.  &#x200B;  My wife and I don't have a home/apartment, we are currently staying in an expensive, absolutely ghetto extended stay because it's the only one that allows pets.  She has had a month to get all of this in order, I know you can't help getting sick, but come the 16th that house is OURS.  Why do we have to eat even more costs of staying in this extended stay while she would have two homes?  What can we do?  Do we have legal rights to kick her out?  Make her pay for our hotel costs from the 16th to whenever she gets out?\n### Comment:\n",

            "2FA means you need to authenticate with two factors, generally something you know (your password) and something you have (ideally, an authenticator app, but in this case SMS). Generally speaking, 2FA is something you have to turn on in your account settings, and, as a hacker this isn't something you would do unless you were trying to lock the true owner out of their account. At this point the theft has already happened and 2FA doesn't even matter anymore. Such that you need to turn on 2FA, generally, that means you also are registering your second factor of authentication (phone number or authenticator app). Your phone is something you would have, and thusly receiving a text to a number you registered somewhat satisfies that requirement.  There are ways to intercept these messages as a malicious actor, but targeting an individual isn't likely, especially if they already have 2FA turned on. It's much more likely that they would attack a password storage provider like Lastpass to gain access to many more credentials they store. 2FA kicks in here because if in if they could decrypt the passwords they've stolen, they couldn't also log in without your phone, which is simply something most hackers aren't going to bother trying to steal, unless of course you are a notable person and targeting you would bear rewards making that additional risk possible. If you're on reddit, you're probably not one of those people.": 0.0,
            "There's a couple things here.  First, SMS isn't end-to-end encrypted, but it is encrypted over-the-air. An attacker with radio can't just intercept your SMS messages. It can be intercepted by your carrier, someone who's hacked the carrier, or someone using a stingray (eg: the police) who's convinced your phone to connect.  Second, \"2FA\" literally means \"second factor authentication\" -- there's already been another factor used to initiate this action, which is usually a username+password.  This means to successfully attack a user's account on a service using 2FA:  1. The attacker needs to know the username and password 2. The attacker has to have inside access to the carrier's network equipment OR the attacker has to have a stingray and be nearby to have your phone connect to it  This significantly reduces the chance of a successful attack.  The real problem with SMS 2FA:  * SIM swaps are too easy -- this is where someone basically steals your phone number by pretending to be you and getting the number transferred to their own device. Sometimes this is social engineering, sometimes it's via an insider working for the phone company, sometimes it's hacking the carrier. * Too many places don't actually use this as a \"second\" factor, especially for password resets. The most common exploit is an attacker starts a password reset request, verifies the SMS (usually via SIM swap but could also be another hack), and then sets the password to whatever they want, and now own the account. In the case of an account take-over, they'll change the SMS and/or email address to ones they control and you're totally locked out.": 1.0

My boss wanted me to find sources of inefficiencies and how to improve on their process (aka save some money).  I started by going through the production line myself to understand the process a bit better. Then I began talking to operators explaining to them what I had been hired to do and simply asked them what exactly they did and how their portion of the line worked. For the most part, all of the operators faced no issues and were rather happy. I finally made it to the operators that runs a machine which applied adhesive to the product. I could tell right away that this is where my efforts were going to be dedicated because the line would consistently pause here due to issues.  A serious redesign/modification of the machine/process would have had to take place, but for now the operators were using a bandaid fix: they were using cans of PAM to prevent adhesive buildup that would eventually cause the line to slow down so the operator could clear the buildup. I ended up saving the company a couple hundred dollars a month in PAM (they were going through an insane amount of cans) by ordering an air-atomizing sprayer off McMasterCarr and figuring out the mixture for homemade cooking oil spray (a combination of cooking oils and the right amount of soy lecithin I bought from a Nutrishop).

            "Into the air.  Generally, higher global temperatures mean more evaporation, and since our system is a closed loop, it also means more snow- and rainfall. So on average the world should be getting _wetter_, as we push the average temperature up.  But that\u2019s at a steady state. While the average temperature is _increasing_, so is the ability of that air to hold water. There\u2019s more evaporation than precipitation! If the global temperature were decreasing, it\u2019d be the reverse and we\u2019d have more rainfall as the cooling Earth squeezed water out of the atmosphere.  But now let\u2019s bring terrain into it. I just made the case for increased evaporation and decreased rainfall. But as we dry things out, the amount of evaporation going on can actually _decrease_. A third of our planet is land- and when you dry out some of that land you\u2019re decreasing the surface area subject to evaporation no matter what the temperature.  When you melt glaciers and snowpacks and flow them into the sea, same thing.  That magnifies the effects we started with on a warming planet. Forests and grasslands become deserts, and deserts don\u2019t contribute much to evaporation and thus you have a vicious cycle of aridification.  Massive desalination and irrigation projects might help. Water the desert, plant a forest there; but the energy cost would be monstrous. We\u2019ve done exactly the reverse, because humans are such pigs: we suck water out of the ground and out of rivers, and then pollute it so badly that we don\u2019t want it back. So we send our nitrogen, plastic, toxin-laden wastewater to the ocean and pray that rain will save us while simultaneously doing almost everything we can to reduce that rainfall.": 1.0

My wipers were on high, however the wipers did need to be replaced and I knew that when buying the car. I was in a 35 going 30 because of the severe weather. I wanted to pull over but had no where to go. After driving in the storm for a few minutes the car in front of my turns on their right signal and starts breaking, I started to break as soon as I saw their lights come on. I gradually pressed harder on the break pedal like normal but I did not slow down or stop. I pressed harder and expected to have a hard stop but again, I did not stop and next thing I know my airbags deployed and I was involved in an accident.   When the officer calmed me down and asked me what happened I explained and he said \u201cit honestly sounds like you hydroplaned, keep in mind the roads are the most slippery shortly after it starts to rain\u201d.   Should I consider getting a lawyer for this? I was told the judge in this township is super forgiving for first time offenders.  One last question, is this something where I can plead guilty or not guilty and be free of charges?   Thank you so much in helping work through this stressful situation.",

            "To sum up what the rest of the commenters are saying, during a phase change, energy can be altered without changing temperature. This is because temperature is a function of the kinetic energies of the individual molecules. Normally, energy raises the kinetic energy of these molecules. However, during a phase change, this energy does not raise the kinetic energy, but goes into overcoming the intermolecular forces of that particular state (when lowering energy, the reverse is true).  This is also why all of the water in the pot doesn't instantly boil at once when 100C is reached. As more energy is pumped in, more and more forces are overcome, and the water gradually turns into steam.  As for an actual Explain like I'm five years old attempt: Temperature is how much molecules move around. Molecules like to hold each other's hands. When you add more energy, the molecules get excited and start dancing. As more energy is put into the system, they dance faster. At a certain point, however, they are dancing so fast that it is hard for them to hold onto each other. The next bits of energy go into breaking the molecules' firm grips on each other. They really like holding hands, so this takes a lot of energy. After none of the molecules are holding hands any more (at least not as strongly - a substance can have multiple phase transitions), they are all still dancing at the same speed even though more energy has been put into the system. If more energy is added, the molecules will once again resume dancing faster and faster.": 0.0,

That is why the water at the bottom getting heated by the burner is what starts to turn to gas, and then those gas bubbles rise up through the water, causing it to \u201cboil\u201d.  The water in the cup isn\u2019t getting directly heated by the burner, so it\u2019ll start to steam and evaporate, but all the main energy that makes the big pot boil is coming from the burner.": 1.0

            "Average life expectancies for populations tend to get shorter the further into the past you go.  Of course, in the past, some people lived into their 80s, with evidence from places like ancient egypt (2400BCE),where the Egyptian Vizier Ptahhotep wrote verses about the disintegrations of old age, and Greece, where they classed old age among the divine curses, and their tombstones attest to survival well past 80 years. Ancient artworks and figurines also depict elderly people: stooped, flabby, wrinkled.  &#x200B;  https://www.sapiens.org/biology/human-lifespan-history/  &#x200B;  Concerning life expectancy, a variety of factors had an impact on the average age of a person  at death.  Almost half of all births ended in death before the age of 5, greatly lowering the average.  When infant mortality is removed, evidence seem to show averages of life expectancy for 3000 years ago to be around 52, give or take 15 years.  &#x200B;  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2625386/  &#x200B;  Can people live to 150?  Likely not.  Studies have shown that the estimated maximum of the human life span is around 125 years, under ideal conditions.  This maximum would have been the same in previous generations, though the life-expectancies of those generations were limited by conditions that were not ideal - lack of medicine, for example, famine, war, and so on.  &#x200B;  https://learn.age-up.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-human-longevity/  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-008-9156-4": 1.0

The emphasis in public discourse seem to be about absolutely not letting the other side win.  This of course is a reasonable thing to do as it can prevent an abhorent option from winning the elections and then ruling the country into a worse future.  But I've seen people say we should instead ignore that and just vote to support the option we want to win, even if it has no chance ... which will certainly take votes away from the lesser evil option that could win - effectively handing the victory over to the greater evil!\n### Comment:\n",

            "When in culinary school, the acronym FATTOM was used to explain the conditions that bacteria need to grow.  **F**ood (duh)  **A**cidity: the pH of the item has to be within a specified range; more neutral generally means better conditions for bacteria to grow. Something acidic enough will kill bacteria, which is why something like ceviche works.  **T**emperature: the \"danger zone\" of 41-135F is where bacteria grow the most easily, with somewhere between 60-80F being the \"extreme danger zone,\" where it's *really* easy for growth to occur. You can kill bacteria above this temperature, but not below; refrigerating or freezing an item just slows or stops the bacteria from multiplying, but doesn't permanently disable them.  **T**ime: it takes time for the cells to split and reproduce.

Rice, in its raw form, has little to no \"accessible\" moisture that bacteria can use to feed and grow. When you cook it, you introduce a great deal of moisture to the party, and the bacteria can then begin to reproduce.

            "If I understand right, you're trying to give the meat an outer sear (which also puts some fond in the pot) on the hob and to finish the rest of the cooking process in the oven (I assume there are additional steps inbetween.).  The reason for doing the browning/searing on the hob/stove is that you get a nice hot surface that can actually do a sear, exactly what you do with a fry pan.  The oven simply doesn't give you a hot enough surface to achieve a sear.  The searing process develops flavour (Maillard reaction).  Doing it in the pot makes it easier to prepare in and retain flavour because all the fond is developed in and stays in the cooking vessel.  If you don't do the searing process, you can end up with a grey meat which can be visually unappealing.  You also don't get a lot of the complex flavours from the caramelization from the Maillard reaction.  The secondary cooking in the oven (pot with the lid on) allows for a much slower, gentler and more controlled way of thoroughly cooking the meat.  Brisket needs to be cooked slowly as it is a really tough cut of meat (lots of connective tissue) with lots of fat; cooking it fast on a high heat will just give you a tough and chewy mass.  It's why you see so many slow cooker recipes for it to make it \"so tender that the meat falls apart\".  Keeping the lid on helps retain moisture.  Although you can leave a gap for moisture to leave near the end of cooking to allow for the sauces to thicken.  EDIT: Updated based on comment below.": 1.0

I'm worried about possible implications for ownership of the property. My mother owns a house with about two acres of backyard, including a small barn. Her next door neighbors have a bunch of kids who she often babysits for free and refers to as her \"grandchildren.\" She has now made a deal with the neighbors that they can use about 2/3 of her yard, including the barn, to let their kids play, as well as to raise chickens and grow a garden. This way, she says, she doesn't have to mow or landscape on that part of the yard.  The neighbors have now put up a wooden fence through the middle of the yard, cutting off a small section of yard for my mother's use and reserving the bulk for themselves. My mother is okay with this because it's less yard for her to maintain, but I think it's also because she is lonely and I'm worried that the neighbors are taking advantage of her. She is very religious, and the neighbors are in her same denomination of Christianity so she trusts them implicitly.  I just want to know if there's a chance that, at some point, the fence and/or their permission to use the land as they see fit will create a legal issue where they can actually take over the property.

Complete the request to the best of your ability.\n\n### Instruction:\nWrite a comment to the reddit post from the subreddit r/legaladvice that would receive as many upvotes as possible.\n### Post Content\n[PA] My mother has allowed the neighbors to put a fence up through her yard and to take over most of it for their use, including a small barn that is part of her property. I'm worried about possible implications for ownership of the property. My mother owns a house with about two acres of backyard, including a small barn. Her next door neighbors have a bunch of kids who she often babysits for free and refers to as her \"grandchildren.\" She has now made a deal with the neighbors that they can use about 2/3 of her yard, including the barn, to let their kids play, as well as to raise chickens and grow a garden. This way, she says, she doesn't have to mow or landscape on that part of the yard.  The neighbors have now put up a wooden fence through the middle of the yard, cutting off a small section of yard for my mother's use and reserving the bulk for themselves. My mother is okay with this because it's less yard for her to maintain, but I think it's also because she is lonely and I'm worried that the neighbors are taking advantage of her. She is very religious, and the neighbors are in her same denomination of Christianity so she trusts them implicitly.  I just want to know if there's a chance that, at some point, the fence and/or their permission to use the land as they see fit will create a legal issue where they can actually take over the property. From a selfish point-of-view, that property is a large part of mine and my brother's inheritance, and I don't want us to have to battle it out with these neighbors when the time comes.

I was the first car he hit and he destroyed a car I loved. I came out with just a bloody nose, the guy crashed into me at 60 mph... I was lucky I guess but he caused a 4 car pile-up, my car was pushed into a truck with KIDS in the back seat, and the car in front of that was a grandma that acknowledged this dude drunk drove and was caught multiple times.   &#x200B;  So the police never sent me a package I requested to charge this guy, they said the city was doing enough. I hired an attorney that stopped replying after a month.   &#x200B;  Sure this dude is a native american but he was driving a company truck and hit me at 60mph and he has admitted to driving drunk and didnt see an obvious red light because he was texting.  This was in flagstaff so not native land.   &#x200B;  I am over 10,000 in debt and my attorney bailed on me, the police never sent the files to charge this guy for almost killing me.  &#x200B;  Please help!\n### Comment:\n",

There's some momentum present in the fluid, so when you accelerate there will be a shift in pressure differential towards the rear, and when you brake there will be a shift towards the front.

The citric acid would leave it's characteristic aromas or congeners bound to water in a sauce but left hot for a duration would lose some piquancy in comparison to acetic acid.  Volatility of acetic acid at room temperature is notably high by comparison to citric acid however... Meaning it can go stale over very long durations if left uncovered, in part because the acetic acid is not the only component that we perceive as vinegar when tasting. Citric Acid is not dissimilar as it too is not the only component that we perceive as citrus acidity, some of those components are oil based and can oxidize over time degrading the expected flavor into something less desirable.  Hope this helps.  TLDR for cold applications dealers choice depending on taste and preference. For Hot applications there are objective functional differences.

They hit a station, but no idea what station.   And they hear two people talking about an event.  When they get done talking, they identify themselves as KVHT 730 AM radio out of Bumblestan Michigan.   Well now you have some measure of trustworthiness to it, or the ability to find out.  (Is this a well respected local station, or the station always reporting we are about to be invaded by aliens)  And also, if you thought it was a good news program, you can make a point of trying to tune in again tomorrow now that you know what station you were listening to.  And so it makes sense for stations to identify themselves.  And not just at the end.  Most stations will try to identify themselves every 10 minutes or so.  This means during a 30 minute interview or 30 minute news program they find good breaks to identify themselves.  At the start and at the end are pretty good spots to use that don't break the flow of the show.  It's not like a newspaper where you can be reading an article and think highly of the reporter and just glance back on top and see who wrote it.  Or even at the title of the piece.  This is often why you hear them frequently reintroduce who they are interviewing if it's longer than 5 minutes.  All this was true of early TV were even though you knew the set was on channel 5, playing with the antenna you might be getting channel 5 from city A 200 miles away to the east, or city B 200 miles to the west, or city C or D to the north or south.  And personally, I still listen to various news radio.  Big NPR fan.

Or even worse because they have \u2018management\u2019 experience. They then enter a position where they\u2019re no longer answerable and become both arrogant and lazy.   In short.. I\u2019m finding it harder and harder to give two shits about what my boss says. I just want to complete my tasks to the best I can. This guy has adhd and tells me to make changes to projects based on spur of the moment thoughts and this almost always results in a worse solution. He has appointed myself and two other \u2018team leads\u2019 who are all responsible for 7 people, so he in effect, doesn\u2019t have to do his job.   I\u2019m becoming increasingly frustrated with this. If anyone has any advice for dealing with a situation like this I\u2019d love to hear it. Thanks\n### Comment:\n",

            "Flat feet are a common cause of general musculoskeletal pain and problems. Your body\u2019s balance begins in the feet; when the feet do not provide proper support, it can raise your risk for joint problems caused by poor posture and unnatural gait. Individuals with flat feet could be more likely to experience injury or pain in the feet, ankles, knees, or hips. A condition called plantar fasciitis is more common in people with flat feet as well. Plantar fasciitis occurs when the tendons in the feet are overstretched. This condition causes severe pain in the feet, especially in the morning.  Flat feet tend to cause another condition called overpronation, which is when the ankles roll inward while you\u2019re walking. This can lead to foot and ankle pain.  Because your feet are the basis of support for your entire body, having flat feet and overpronation can cause problems with your spinal alignment.

Alabama just paused lethal injection because of a 3rd failed attempt. It doesnt make sense to play with new sciencey materials to execute a death penalty. It makes infinitely more sense, ethically, to line up 12 rifleman with 6 of the guns randomly loaded blanks, all aiming at someones head.

My advisor called me in and showed me what he wrote for my LoR and asked me if I wanted to change anything (I don't think this is normal or \"ethical\" but who am I to say no to a kind gesture).  I'm not originally from my current major (CS) and I did a double major in undergrad. My grades suffered because of my unfamiliarity and, to be honest, immaturity. My advisor mentioned it in the letter and said something like (from memory):  >Although I admittedly had concerns as to whether Joe would be able to keep up with graduate courses and conduct research due to his unconventional background and his undergraduate record, he immediately proved that my concerns were silly as he was able to maintain a near-perfect GPA and was able to successfully participate in research.  I'm honestly extremely flattered that my advisor thinks so highly of me (he's not the expressive type), but at the same time am conflicted because I've heard that anything critical or mediocre on a letter is going to be viewed negatively.

He mentioned my poor undergrad grades but \"put a positive spin\" on them. Should I ask him to remove it? Hello community. Please remove if not appropriate. Thanks.  I'm an international MS student looking to apply for PhD programs in the US this round. My advisor called me in and showed me what he wrote for my LoR and asked me if I wanted to change anything (I don't think this is normal or \"ethical\" but who am I to say no to a kind gesture).  I'm not originally from my current major (CS) and I did a double major in undergrad. My grades suffered because of my unfamiliarity and, to be honest, immaturity. My advisor mentioned it in the letter and said something like (from memory):  >Although I admittedly had concerns as to whether Joe would be able to keep up with graduate courses and conduct research due to his unconventional background and his undergraduate record, he immediately proved that my concerns were silly as he was able to maintain a near-perfect GPA and was able to successfully participate in research.  I'm honestly extremely flattered that my advisor thinks so highly of me (he's not the expressive type), but at the same time am conflicted because I've heard that anything critical or mediocre on a letter is going to be viewed negatively.  This has led me to wonder if I should bring it up and suggest that leaving out the part about concerns may be best.  I don't really have anyone around me who's experienced higher education (my school doesn't really receive international students/faculty and no one really goes abroad either, I'm also the only one of my friends or family to have went to college) and so I decided I'd try to make a post here.

            "I'll chime in to agree that it probably wasn't halloumi (there are some cheaper cheeses that sort of imitate the style, but halloumi won't act like that, and should have worked the way you described cooking it), but furthermore to point out that halloumi isn't particularly tough to make yourself if it's hard to find or expensive, and you can control the level of salt and other flavours you want in it. Mozzarella is often recommended as a starter cheese but it can be a little tough to figure out how to pull it while it's so hot without making it come out as a brick, while halloumi is supposed to be really tight so no real worries about overworking it.  At a bare minimum you need decent non-UHT milk, rennet (can buy online or from specialty stores depending on where you are), salt, a stove, a thermometer that works into the boiling range (don't need a candy thermometer, won't get that hot), and basics like a knife and big spoon that you probably already have. It will come out subjectively better/tastier if you also get hold of a cheese culture and maybe calcium chloride depending on your milk.  It makes a decent mess in the kitchen and milk may be expensive (but so is halloumi near me!), but it's not really much more difficult than reasonably involved cooking. Just be willing to watch your temps carefully.": 0.0,

Also, the government works really slowly.

            "I've been thinking as I read others responses.  I expect that op is thinking about a system like Avatar's Pandora world, and I agree with others that it is probably impossible to get that concept to function. It takes quite a lot of gravity to hold a breathable atmosphere, and the asteroids have so much more mass density that they'd be constantly crushed towards each other and form a rocky planet rather quickly if they collectively had that much gravity.  Avatar poses a solution of some form of electromagnetic repulsion that keeps their floating islands apart, but real magnetism doesn't *do* that. The islands would just flip and flop around until they slid into a magnetically stable and lowest energy state. Perhaps with some kind of intelligent intervention that could manipulate the fields and/or some other forces to keep all the islands oriented in the high-energy repulsive orientations, but it would require insane amounts of energy and processing power.  BUT, I am considering the case of Saturn. Saturn has so many pseudo-moons or moonlets that keep orbiting in and out of the atmosphere that many don't even get \"proper\" names, just catalogue numbers.  One could theorize that a meaningful number of similar and smaller objects could be orbiting entirely within Saturn's atmosphere, and will never be seen by humans.   Making an even larger assumption that you can have a Saturn-like gas planet built with breathable gasses, one could conceive of a system of orbiting island mini moons within a livable pressure zone and having sufficiently circular orbits so that their highest and lowest pressures are still survivable.   Inhabitants would experience weightlessness between the planetary gravity and the experience of centrifugal forces of the island-moons' orbital speed, though island-moons with mass approaching that of Earth's moon would have a limited gravity field all their own.  This world wouldn't look or work like Pandora, though, even if the orbital velocities of these island-moons were all fairly uniform (somehow). They would be in constant movement relative to one another and collisions would be common.": 0.0,

            "Others have also replied, but yes, these are hacksaw or bandsaw blades that have been sharpened on one end and have a wooden handle attached at one end. Very very cheap (about 20 cents), and gets really sharp because it is high carbon steel like old school French chef knives. And not just that - they also sharpen very easily as it is soft steel. Just a few strokes on a stone or even a smooth granite kitchen ledge would sharpen these blades.  Again, downside of any high carbon steel knife, including these ones, is that it rusts very easy and develops a patina. And you need to wipe it dry right away after use.  I used to have a few and often preferred it to some of the other chef knives i had. Which was funny because of how cheap these are compared to a chef knife. These are great for slicing and dicing, and it also helps that they have a very thin blade profile unlike some chef knives that tend to be thick and hefty.

When I first mentioned this to my landlord he spoke to the tenent and for a few days our neighbor wouldnt idle his truck for longer then 5 minutes which was fine because it takes about 15 for the livingroom and bedroom to start smelling like exhaust.

When both my fiance and I spoke to our neighbor we told him we honestly dont care if he idles his truck, so long as his truck end isnt backed up to our window. His reply was that it would be too hard for him to get out of his parking space if he parked any other way. ( we live on a narrow street and peole park on the street because all the multifamily apartment/homes offer little off street parking.  My landlord seems bothered that we as tenents cant work this out, and trust me I wish we could,  but I feel this is an unhealthy situation. I've even offered my landlord to walk through my apartment when hes had his truck idling for so long so he can see that im not just complaining against my neighbor.   A friend suggested we threaten to stop paying rent if it continues but I feel that would put us in the wrong and we'd just get evicted. I dont want to aggrevate the situation I just want to stop the smell from getting into our small home. What are my legal options to make it so we dont have to wake up to exhaust fumes?",

This is how the heat from the sun is transferred through empty space to Earth and how the heat from a fire can warm you even though the air goes up into the air. And we can measure how much energy comes from each direction and therefore get a temperature of everything. And it turns out the universe is pretty cold.

I dont think i would watch anymore of they could dunk.  My issue is with one and not the other is not the dunking. Its the general lacl of athleticism and pace. An NBA lay up is often exciting where as a WNBA lay up is only exciting if it is crucial for the game.  There is also an issue that basketball hoops around the country are 10 feet not 9 feet. If the WNBA makes the hoops 9 feet l, you are severely limiting players ability to practice on most of the country. Every high school and college would have to change their courts to accomodate this change because of title 9 which would cause a number of programs to go under.

Since like the atoms which make up a grain of sand are the same size as those making up the earth currently. So the atoms would remained uncharged in your son's what if.  To give an idea of how small atoms are, you could give a visual idea by saying that your son would need a 100,000,000 of them on stacked on top of each other in a line to cover the length of your sons finger nail.  To give idea of scale, you could have your son draw one thing, then write the \"1\"one under it.   Then have him draw ten things, then like before write 10 under it.  Then ask him to draw 100 things(this bit could keep him busy for a bit, which is a plus if you need to keep him occupied lol). Once done write 100 under it.  This will help to link in his head how much bigger things get as they move up by powers of ten.  Then don't make him draw it, but write out 1000, then under that 10,000 etc to show how many times it got bigger to reach 100,000,000.  Finally go back to his drawing,line the hundred up under the ten under the one image.  Point out instead of going \"up\" higher bigger sizes. You can move \"down\" and by powers of ten to get smaller and smaller things.  Go in reverse.  Which is why it takes so many atoms to fit on his finger nail.

Up to a certain stress, the metal will behave *elastically* meaning it will be stretched but return to original length/shape when you remove the force. Above that particular stress, it will behave plastically meaning things called dislocations will be transported through the lattice structure in the metal causing the metal to not return to original shape when load is removed. (If it\u2019s brittle material the material will usually break before much plastic deformation occurs).  If the material is heated up you can get something called creep where the thing under stress would continue to elongate or deform under a constant stress as long as the creep mechanism has enough energy to activate (from the temp). I think at low temps the dominant mechanism would be grains sliding against each other.  Also I think magnetism decreases with temperature so might be hard to create conditions where you can creep some metal with a magnet.  So if you had a sample that melts close to room temperature and can exhibit magnetism, then you could probably continuously plastically deform that sample.": 1.0

Sure, have them pay extra attention to the math in their high school classes and make sure to track their progress in it, but math is just a tool that engineers use to solve problems, it isn't the whole thing.  The most important part to be an engineer is to be curious, and especially curious about science and experimentation. I would say switch your worry into excitement that your sons have something that excites them, and make sure they build confidence in their own selves as well as tools such as math/physics in high school.  To back up my statement: I struggled in math in high school, and dropped out of honors physics and felt lost. But in college I found my love for electrical engineering which I thought was artistic and allowed me to use my imagination. This pushed me to get good at the math and science, and fast forward few years, I am now doing a PhD in engineering and about to go for my 3rd NASA internship.  Your sons are lucky to have such a caring parent like you. You're doing an amazing job in the real world. Best of luck! Peace, love :-)": 1.0

If you're not, maybe try cutting it a different way. The more you can make your steak look like it's chewed up, the more tender it will feel in the mouth.   It also helps to cut the steak at a bias (not straight down, but like 45 degrees relative to the cutting board). This makes thinner slices more appealing and increases the surface area of the sliced meat (more tenderness and places for seasoning).": 1.0

Simple question. Asking this because I frequently cook for my family, easily 10-15 people. I very often go for pasta because it's a crowd pleaser and it's relatively easy to cook for a large crowd (marinara sauce, pesto, etc. are easy to make in large quantities while still maintaining flavor).  However, boiling a like 6 pounds of pasta has proven to be annoying for me. I literally have like 3 or 4 pots going only to cook pasta. How do restaurants/caterers do this when they have to serve dozens of people at the same time? I can't imagine they're constantly having 10 pots going just to cook pasta, do they? Do they have specialized equipment? Just trying to learn something from them, it could make my life easier. And I'm just curious, lol.\n### Comment:\n",

            "Silver tarnishes when exposed to air. The tarnish has a higher resistance so it will heat up when electricity passes through it. The heat causes more tarnishing, which causes more heat... which causes fires.  Copper also tarnishes but not nearly as badly as silver. Gold doesn't tarnish at all.  Price is also a factor. Copper is about 20% the price of silver, so if you need more current, you can just use more copper in the wires instead of going for silver. Gold is much more expensive, but it is only used as a thin gold plating on contact points between components.  I have never tried soldering silver, but I think the tarnish would make it difficult for the solder to stick to the metal. That would also require silver to be cleaned with a polish before any soldering work was done on it.

This information is then put into a computer with an excel file-like spreadsheet and digitally maps the coordinates of the stars and systems to make a cloud of points which can be manipulated in 3d on a computer. More stars can be added to this but to get a \"picture\" of the milky way, an artist is given the program and information concerning gas clouds and such (what give color to galaxies).

EDIT: You could look at it like making a map of terrain by standing on a hill and drawing what you see. If you had some survey equipment to calculate some angles, you could fairly precisely determine distances to every tree, creek, river, or house that you can see. You can make a very accurate map by only moving around the hill slightly to change the angles to objects, to give you something to calculate (known distance between observation points and known angles). That small movement around the top of the hill  getting various angles is analogous to the earth's revolving around the sun.": 1.0

Bank A deducts funds from your account and Bank B credit funds to the recipient\u2019s account. Then the two banks settle the transaction by crediting and debiting their bank accounts with the national reserve bank (Federal Reserve, Bank of England etc\u2026). To make it easier the banks will batch thousands or millions of transactions in both directions and pay the net difference once a day or so.   For international transfers there is no global reserve bank. So, the banks do it with each other in a system called correspondent banking.

This we know from Hawking's modification of Penrose's ideas. We know from looking that such situations occur, and that there are objects we can only understand as black holes (again, considering only GR). Note that the singularity is the point in space and time at which everything in the black hole ends up.  However, we know that GR is at odds with reality: quantum gravity is famously elusive; the universe inflated early on; singularities themselves aren't really self-consistent in GR, so more needs to be understood and this will likely affect predictions of how singularities behave.  For a specified mass there is an associated Schwarzschild radius; if the mass is all within this radius, it will collapse into a black hole.": 0.0,
            "Just to give a mathematical description of a singularity in simple terms, a singularity is a point where something is undefined and/or the graph has a \"hole\" in it. So y = x^2 / x - 5 would have a singularity at 5 since it would be dividing by zero there.  Keep in mind that blackholes are the outcome of equations that treat space as infinitely divisible (no plank unit) and that aren't compatible with quantum mechanics. That's how they were predicted before being discovered. We know the equations are incomplete and we need a theory of quantum gravity to describe such conditions.

Got up today morning and the milk was totally spoilt. I had stored the milk in an airtight glass bottle and got a loud soda-like **pop** when I opened the cap.  Here is the recipe I followed:  * Soaked 1 cup almonds for 8 hours. Washed them after * Blend them with 3:1 water with a touch of vanilla and honey * Strain milk through nut-bag * Store milk in airtight glass bottle * Refrigerate  I'm not sure where I messed up. Could use some advice on the same. Thanks!\n### Comment:\n",

Even if a single house uses 10x more then average  it'll only be a few % excess load on a single phase. Additionally more homes means a tighter phase control simply due to the reducing variance associated with a large number of houses.": 0.0,
            "So, there is an unfortunate thing that happens when you start to talk about phasing that is less than intuitive. When you think of the three phases in three phase power you think about the hot legs (at least that's how I was thinking of them) but the phasing really refers to the circuit. So A isn't a phase, A to B is a phase. The sub station is sending out 3 phase 3 wire (ground doesn't count) and the bucket transformers you see take one of those phases (or two wires) and step that down and add a neutral wire which gives you your 120/240 at your home. Larger buildings will take all three wires and give 120/208 but will send power to the individual units as if there were only the two incoming wires. So your three phases again aren't A, B, C but rather A - B, B - C, C- A.  As for how they manage, you... okay so it's kinda like how rando off the street can't sing, but you get a concert full of randos and they sound like they can. The wide area interconnect does a pretty good job of averaging out. Pretty good but not perfect. That's where transformers with a higher K rating and increasingly Harmonic Mitigating Transformers come into play.  In a perfect world you would try to balance your loads perfectly but in real life you just get as close as you can and deal with what's left.  HTH.": 1.0

How do i cool down a hot pot of soup without diluting it, leaving it out, or putting it in the fridge? I could put ice in it, but that would dilute the soup.  I could leave it out, but the recipes and advice say not to do that because it will make bacteria grow in it.  I cant put it in the fridge immediately because its still hot and will fuck up the fridge.  Whats the right way to do this?\n### Comment:\n",

Roasting is cooking food that already has a solid structure (think meat and vegetables). Baking is cooking food that begins as a semi-liquid dough or batter that firms up and becomes solid as the food looses moisture during cooking (think bread, cakes and muffins).  \r\u2022\tTemperature \u2013 Oven temperature also distinguishes these two cooking methods. Roasting usually requires higher temperatures (400\u00b0 and above) to create a browned, flavorful crust on the surface of the food; while baking usually occurs at lower temperatures (up to 375\u00b0).\r  \u2022\tFat \u2013 While many baked foods contain fat within; roasted foods are prepared with an outer coating of fat, such as vegetables or meat brushed with olive oil.  \r\u2022\tCovered pan \u2013 Roasting is typically done in an open, uncovered pan, often with direct heat or convection heat; while items that are baked may be covered.": 0.0,

            "It absolutely can be done. There are a lot of videos on Youtube of guys using Tesla coils to make lightning. With enough voltage, you can get sparks many meters long.  There is a catch though. This is NOT a entry level DIY thing. Your average home microwave uses a transformer to change 120 volts up to around 3000 volts.   **This is easily enough to kill you.**  Tesla coils big enough to make lengthy sparks start at 50,000 volts and can go up to a few million volts. Not only is this potent enough to kill you, if you aren't working in a Faraday cage, the stray EM radiation caused by the sparks can get the FCC or CRTC rather annoyed with you. (you'd be causing massive radio interference across large swathes of the radio spectrum)   Where I am, playing around and causing radio interference would likely result in some very stern men in Canadian Army signals uniforms showing up at my door. An un-shielded Tesla would fuck up the air base radar systems and tower communications.   If you're serious about this, I say go for it. But be prepared to learn a lot of electric theory and commit to building a few small sized coils first.": 1.0

While it's true that making Reddit awards cheaper might make them less special, consider that making Reddit awards cheaper would also seem to mean that more people are likely to get acknowledged for making good posts, and awards can also make good posts easier to find.

We need more positivity in the world, superficial as it may seem.  2. There's no way to \"cancel\" an award. By this I mean you can't negate it with an anti-award like is the case with up/down votes. Even heartfelt comments of support are subject to getting down votes into oblivion. It's immune to the popularity contest we are all participants in on social media, and that environment can be very toxic (not always). Flip side is that we as people wishing to cancel awards we disagree with, are left a bit frustrated because we're accustomed to that option. But I think that's more of a growing pain than a real issue.  3. It helps fund the site. More free awards means some people will think about buying them who would otherwise have not.

He was being held prisoner in that cave by terrorists who'd threatened to kill him if he didn't produce some results, which is a powerful motivator.  4. There's no indication he had anything else to do but tinker with those parts and try to invent something.

If interest is calculated once, at the end of the year, you would have $2000, right?  Suppose I now say the annual rate is still 100% but I'll calculate the interest and add it on to your original amount every six months.  (So 50% return each half year).    This would make you $250 better off!  (As you now *also* get the second half of the year's 50% on the first half of the year's $500 interest.)  So, the more often we calculate the interest, the better - even though the yearly return is still 100%  Let's take it further.   If the interest calculation was monthly, then the yearly return would be $1613.  So 2.61 times your starting amount by me just splitting your 100% return into smaller slices.  So the question is - how far can we take this?  What effective return would we get if we recalculated daily?  hourly?  every minute?  Well it turns out that the answer is 'e'.    If we could recalculate the 100% interest every second or less then we would get end up with $2718.28": 1.0

            "Our bodies aren't designed to break down and digest the cellulose that makes up the cell walls of most vegetable material which is why it just passes through us and you find corn and peanuts in.. well... you know. Since we can't digest this so-called \"roughage\" the gut just quickly moves it along, and if raw vegetables form a large proportion of your diet then it's going to come out like diarrhea.  The key phrase you'll often see used is \"balanced diet\". Raw vegetables and it's roughage are essential to keep your poop moving along a healthy pace when it's balanced with the other elements of a \"balanced diet.\" Too little roughage and you might skew towards constipation. Too much roughage and you might go in the other direction.  Raw diets are usually inefficient and typically do a disservice to your body since the vitamins and nutrients are locked in those cells made of undigestible cellulose. Your body simply can't get to them. To increase the bio-availability of those vitamins and nutrients those cell walls need to be broken, usually through grinding and blending or through chopping and plenty of chewing. Cooking your veg is a faster and more efficient way to break those cell walls.  edit to add: The above is for a person with a healthy digestive system. If you're experiencing lots of difficulty eating even a salad and a piece of fruit with a meal as part of a balanced diet, then you might have other issues and a visit to your doctor might be in order. Some fresh vegetables are also difficult to wash, notable green onions and leafy greens, as they have places where bacteria can hide and cause illness. Other factors besides eating too much roughage may be involved and deserve consideration.": 1.0

Bruce would/should have been in a better place, both as a person and as a hero. So what did Bruce do RIGHT with Jason, compared to Dick?\n### Comment:\n",

            "Newer tech often isn't as good as older, established tech that's been standard for a long time, but people are still drawn to the shininess of new tech. We see this again and again.  People were wowed by early ugly polygon games when sprite-based games from that era looked extraordinary.  People are currently shelling out hundreds of dollars for fancy automated wine bottle openers when a waiter's corkscrew is superior and only a few dollars.  People lined up to pay top dollar for Nividia's 20XX series of cards because they had ray-tracing, even though games weren't really playable with it turned on at the time.  My grandfather bought one of the early cars to have power windows and power locks. He nearly died when it malfunctioned on a hot day and he ended up locked in his car with no way out and no way to start the car. This when traditional locks worked just fine. He swore he'd never buy another car like that, but a few years later when he needed a new car he did.  I remember back in the 80s when they started putting clocks on coffee makers, so people would leave them plugged in so they wouldn't reset the clock, and it would start house fires. Not sure why a coffee maker needs a clock, but at the time putting clocks on things was the new tech trend.  There will always be a significant part of the population who's attracted to the shiny new tech, and it's also a status symbol. Can you imagine someone in Vader's position using outdated technology?

            "I'd like to propose that the Grinch, despite being very humanlike in his appearance, is actually a mustelid like a weasel. Certain animals like the weasel and the shrew have the ability to change the sizes of their internal organs as a rare but effective survival strategy. In fact, it is common to see this \"overgrowth\" happen in juveniles, suggesting that the Grinch is biologically far younger than the film portrays him to be.  >  While the shrinking likely facilitates survival during seasonal low resource availability in these high-metabolic mammals with year-round activity, the regrowth may be most strongly influenced by high investment into reproduction and territories, which is male-biased in the weasels  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28211896/  We can see this in two forms in the movie. First of all, we can see that the Grinch is extremely attracted to Martha May Whovier with clearly venereal intent. The second can be seen with his identification with Mount Crumpit, which up to his point has been his territory. His heart, therefore, shrunk to fit the low resource of \"love\" that he was both physically and emotionally blocked from. With the advent of Cindy Lou Who teaching him the true meaning of Christmas, the Grinch's territory has expanded from just his quaint aiguille home into the entire society of Whoville. That made his heart grow.   Unfortunately the organ overgrowth in weasels is temporary, so the Grinch may revert to the normal Grinch level over time. But in the meantime he'll be able to gain the benefits of AHS before his body's biology naturally corrects itself. That should help him move any large objects that inexplicably have gotten themselves between him and his new territory.": 1.0

The fundamental problem with homemade ice cream is the formation of ice crystals which makes the ice cream hard and unscoopable. If you only make soft serve you are fine, but if you want to take hardened ice cream out of the freezer and scoop it out, it will be harder with homemade ice cream because of ice crystals.   You can add emulsifiers or other ingredients to try to mitigate the effect. But the #1 thing you need to do is to shorten the amount of time the ice cream takes to completely freeze once it\u2019s done.  In a commercial setting, once the ice cream finishes churning it immediately goes into a blast freezer which rapidly cools it to a very low temperature (I think -20 F). During this time, every minute counts. At this temperature the ice cream is unscoopable. Once it\u2019s sufficiently frozen, it can then be moved to a more standard freezer where it can stay before serving.  So, the best way to get commercial grade ice cream isn\u2019t to get a slightly higher grade ice cream maker, but to get a blast freezer at your house.": 0.0,

The theory is that super-quick freezing will make smaller ice crystals (which is true) and that yields a better texture. But the right technique and recipe will also yield a delightful texture.   The obvious thing that a compressor model can do that a freezer bowl model can't is make multiple batches in a row. The less obvious thing that a compressor model can do that a freezer bowl model can't is handle certain recipes that require a lot of freezing, like salted caramel, say.": 1.0
