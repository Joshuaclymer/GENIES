If it's publically available, then it's free to use.  To go with an example of someone switching from SpaceX to Boeing, let's say SpaceX has a special alloy they use with a secret formula to have lighter rockets. They have a public article on the alloy saying the alloy is 'a special aluminum blend'.   Let's say your role at both jobs was material strength with aluminum alloys. You're in a meeting discussing how to improve a rocket.  You can't say that SpaceX has a better alloy with x% more strength and y% lighter, but you can say SpaceX has a special aluminum that is supposed to be better.   Going forward from there you can say that you have to be removed from that specific project because it could put the company under scrutiny.  Let's say next they need development of an alloy that can handle high temperature. You know SpaceX uses an additive to a well known in industry blend of Al for high temp. It's also common practice for manufacturers to have additives for this blend as well. You could come under scrutiny being part of this project, but if you can prove that experiments were done & SpaceX doesn't it have it under patent.  *But I'm not a lawyer, just suggesting you tread carefully": 1.0

The police are saying I have to reimburse the pawn shop the money they spent to buy it, any advice or help? I will try to keep this short and sweet. I have been selling things on the side for some extra money.   On 11-3-22 (US date) I met with a gentleman who said they wanted to buy the iPad Pro from me for 800 dollars. However, he decided to give me counterfeit money instead.   I went and made a police report a few hours later (I went to three different police stations until I found the right one). I was able to give them the Model and Serial number. That is how it got flagged as stolen.  I called them last week and they mentioned a pawn shop has it.

            "The expected number of \"wins\" in either case is the same: 0.7. But they're distributed differently, so the chance of **at least one** win is different.  The reason is that your ten 7% chances includes the possibility of *multiple* wins. To get the same average number of wins, those multiple wins have to also be balanced out by a higher chance of zero wins.  -----  More mathematically, the chance of zero wins here is the chance of not winning at each step, multiplied together. So for your 10 7% chances, your chance of not winning is 93% (that is, 1 - 0.07), and you end up with (1 - 0.07) \\* (1 - 0.07) \\* ... \\* (1 - 0.07) ten times. That comes out to (1 - 0.07)^10 = (0.93)^10 = about 0.48, or 48%.  It may help to think of things in smaller, easier to intuit numbers. How about one 100% chance and two 50% chances? Obviously two coin flips can come up both tails, so the two must be different, and it's worth actually listing out every option to see why. The single 100% chance has only one option: \"win\". The two 50% chances have four equally likely options: \"win win\", \"win lose\", \"lose win\", and \"lose lose\". In both cases, you average exactly one win, but in the second, the \"win win\" case gets balanced out by a \"lose lose\" one.": 1.0

            "I recently read an article in the Atlantic that I resonated with very much. It offered a very interesting take on the five stages of grief-theory that, I think, pertains to your question:   \u2018After losing her son, a scientist and science writer takes a closer look at grief:  The five-stage model wasn\u2019t generated from data. It\u2019s a theory, developed by the psychiatrist Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross and published in 1969, that explains how people come to terms with their own impending death. I remember watching K\u00fcbler-Ross on television when I was a young teenager, absolutely enthralled, and later buying some of her books. By the time her second one was published, in 1974, K\u00fcbler-Ross had expanded her claims, such that the five stages would apply to the grieving process too. Families go through them once while their loved one faces death, she argued\u2014and then they may again when that person has died. Though I\u2019d been a fan of K\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019s work, mentions of this theory caused me stress when I was in extreme grief. Was my denial \u201cstage\u201d over yet? If not, how long did I have before I\u2019d turn into a rage monster and scare my grandkids? Some grief websites warned that people can move backward and forward through the stages as they grieve\u2014an idea that made me worry that the all-consuming despair could return. That possibility nipped at any sense of hope and encouragement I could muster: My anxiety would ebb, but then the internet whispered, It won\u2019t last.\u2019": 0.0,
            "Regarding modern models of grief, one concept I have come across is \"delayed grieving\".  When a person encounters loss, some people suppress the feelings - often using drugs or alcohol - so that years later they still linger unresolved. A counsellor can guide a person to revisit these feelings. In some cases this can result in the person going through a period of grief many years after the loss - and ideally this results in resolution and more comfortable feelings.": 1.0

Under red alert condition they will only block the most badly aimed shots that are known to the ship's computer to be a threat to known concentrations of lifesigns. Under yellow alert, such orders are countermanded by the system unless an override order is confirmed.  Tactical officers will of course do their best to NOT fire so inelegantly  but the heat of a space battle can of course lead to fast decisions and evasive action from an enemy may reveal a friendly target the officer had not anticipated.  All energy weapons are of course subject to the inverse square law. Particle weapons will also disperse over a distance due to interference with particles in their path. In addition, array/bank focus mechanisms will be varied according to the target's range in order to maximize damage effefts, so will usually be very divergent past that distance.": 0.0,
            "I have some headcanon for this.  I've seen some people mention effective range due to energy dissipation over distance. But as a \"beam\" of energy, it alsi needs to be focused at a point. I would imagine most shots are made with a specific focus point resolved, where the highest intensity of energy can be found. Meaning, a strike beyond (or even before) that focal point would be less energetic.   That would be the most starfleet way to build a weapon and would give it a clear distinction from the way, let's say, a disruptor operates.

If the rate of drainage in a low lying area is less than it's rate of fill then you get water building up. If the rate equals out then you simply have a river or stream. And rivers and streams do lose some water through seepage into the ground but the water is moving too fast for any significant loss of water per volume flowing over an area.  Now a couple geological conditions help lakes reatin their water. Chiefly, the bottoms of a lake is either made up of tight nonporous soil like clays or is part of the bedrock itself.

Also, listen to your superiors; they likely have made the same mistake you\u2019re about to make and generally want you to succeed. Making mistakes is inevitable and groups of engineers tend to be combative rather than supportive. Own your mistakes, it\u2019s a badge of honor and the best way to learn.": 0.0,
            "Never stop asking questions of everything around you. Weird clouds in the sky? Go find out. Confusing thing on the news. Figure out the history behind things. Engineering is applying problem solving techniques to science to get the desired outcome, but you can still hone those techniques in other fields. Develop an inquisitive mind for the world around you and you will be surprised at how you begin to see solutions or methods that aren't apparent to others.  The second thing that quite a few technically focused engineers forget is lose sight of is management systems. Without structure, an engineering firm is just a bunch of smart (or not so smart) people working individually. Figure out how your organisation is structured, work is generated, assigned, checked, approved and issued. Find out how business is developed from clients (or projects if you are client side). If you show interest in this as a young engineer this will give you a massive advantage as you can tailor how you work to the way your company does things. It also helps you understand the bigger picture of what you are doing as well.  The third thing is context. Most graduate engineers end up doing menial tasks (calculations, drawings, etc) that can be seen as monotonous. Its easy to just sit there and plug away at applying your calculation methodology to whatever someone puts in front of you, but this doesn't make you an engineer. This ties into points 1 and 2 where you should always look to understand how and why what you are doing fits into the bigger picture. It may be a design of a ladder or valve, but why are you doing it. What does it accomplish and how does this benefit the wider structure/item.": 1.0

All I did was fry off pancetta until it went crispy  Then I fried garlic and banana shallots, added sliced Savoy cabbage and a bit of vegetable stock, braised for 10-12 minutes, then added a handful of chopped spinach, cooked until the spinach wilted, seasoned with salt and pepper then served.  The veg stock I used was marigold veg bouillon and I didn\u2019t add any other spices or oil other than the pancetta, and everything was fresh from the supermarket that day.\n### Comment:\n",

But the larger the bomb does not mean that the radiating energy spreads any farther than smaller bombs. Beyond a certain point the physical energy (heat, compression wave, etc) completely overrides the damage done by the radiation. It is the neutron radiation, however, that causes physical material to become radioactive by forming isotopes of the existing atoms. The fallout that is generated after the bomb goes off is the physical material that has been bombarded by neutrons and then burnt and turned to ash.  So, the radioactive material that is the fallout, is created by the radiation generated by the initial blast. There is also some residual physical material that may not have been completely destroyed by the compression wave and heat, but for the most part that is negligible compared to the material distributed as fallout.": 1.0

This is due mainly to humans selectively breeding specific 'breeds'; if humans disappeared then these breeds would probably disappear too due to interbreeding. In some cases you have dramatic differences in size/etc that make mating impractical but they still have the same structure of their DNA.   In comparison, wild animals can and will interbreed whenever they feel like it, and are not separated by people based on human preferences like domestic animals, so it's genetic compatibility and common survival traits that end up coalescing into common 'species' that either can't or don't interbreed (often). For example a mix between an owl and a parrot, even if this was possible, would probably not have a viable niche and would not fare well in the evolutionary competition.": 1.0

I also don\u2019t bother with small things like fries, chips, etc because they will cook pretty evenly by just shaking them up.   But for bulky or filled things like egg rolls, samosas, filled wontons I regularly submerge them by putting another fryer basket on top. I\u2019m pretty sure they are made to do this because stacking fryer baskets spaces out perfectly to just submerge the top of the product. Flipping often just doesn\u2019t work with items like this. Egg rolls for example just keep wanting to flip the cooked side back down.   For specific applications like frying chicken, restaurants deal with the unevenness by using pressure fryers.

Once the buffer is full, the parties have to wait. Multiple simultaneous flows each has its own buffer, and the sum of their speeds can be higher.  You can try to select a different server on the SpeedTest application to get a measurement that is more representative of real usage.

            "You may remember being taught that you can't create or destroy energy. There's always the same amount of it. It just changes form (eg from chemical energy to heat when you burn coal) or moves around.  So \"producing energy\" is easy. The heat is energy. What I think you mean is converting that energy into something useful; for example electricity.  Here there is a problem. The laws of thermodynamics say that what matters if you want to get useful work out of heat is the *difference* in temperatures. The bigger the drop in temperatures, the more you can do.  Note: this is not really a question of \"we just don't have the technology\". It is a pretty basic problem.  So, the problem with radioactive waste is that, generally, you can't use it to make enough heat to maintain a decent sized temperature difference to make a significant amount of electricity to make it worthwhile for use in power stations.   But you absolutely can use it to generate electricity if your needs are more modest (for example in a space probe).  There are other things - for example radioactive waste is not very nice stuff so it isn't just a useful source of heat. If you wanted to use it, you'd have quite a bit of extra work to do if you wanted to do it safely. That means that you don't use it for just random bits of domestic power generation (most of the time). Safety is a factor too.  NB: I never like being untruthful, even in an Explain like I'm five years old. When I said earlier that \"you can't create or destroy energy\", that is fine for what we are talking about (practical power generation) but there are quite a lot of very deep subtleties that might come up in your next Explain like I'm five years old.": 0.0,
            "In short, we can't just produce energy from \"heat\", we produce energy from a *difference* in EDIT - \"Temperature\". Energy always flows from hot to cold, just like a waterfall drops water from high to low. You can't just absorb energy from a river on the top of a mountain (it's higher, right?) you need the water to be *falling* to capture the energy.  Radioactive waste *does* produce heat, but let's make it up, if room temperature is 68 F, then the waste is at 78F. Compare this to a car engine where the temperature is around 3,000F.  To make a car drive you use that heat differential of 3,000F to 78F to get useful energy. Or alternatively imagine a waterfall that's just 2 inches, you can't get a useful waterwheel that small to say, run a factory, off a 2 inch waterfall. That's our problem.  The places where something like this *are* useful are applications that are both A. exposed to are really low outside temperature and B. require very, very little power. So essentially, space and the poles and we do use them for this in something called a \"radioisotope thermoelectric generator\".": 1.0

Once I place some on warm cinnamon roll, they kind of get goopy. I feel like Cinnabon cream cheese frosting is so airy that you can feel the bubbles pop in your mouth.   I'm thinking of maybe trying low fat cream cheese and actually using margarine instead of butter. I'm not sure if that'll be enough to match the taste and airy texture. Do you have any advice?\n### Comment:\n",

            "The \"H\" does not have to mean physical hyperactivity. It is frequently mental hyperactivity.  Regardless, we don't have extra stores of energy. We have a lack of dopamine. Focusing on something, especially when takes a lot of effort to focus on the right thing for a sustained period of time, takes extra mental energy, and you absolutely can get tired from just using your mind. Sometimes it takes more energy to not do a thing than it does to do it--resisting is hard work. Also, we often have sleep problems and aren't sufficiently rested when we get up in the morning.": 0.0,
            "It's been awhile since I've thoroughly read up.. but from what I remember ADHD is linked to reduced activity of the brain's Reticular Activating System (RAS).   Your RAS has more than one function - but a major role is to filter information and help you decide what is important to focus on. For example, your RAS is what allows you to sleep through a thunderstorm, but will wake you up to the sound of a crying baby etc.   Without a properly functioning RAS, then EVERY LITTLE THING seems incredibly important and you have to now consciously decide what deserves your focus (and you have to work harder to keep your focus there as your RAS continues to send maydays over any ol trigger).   .. that sounds pretty fricking exhausting to me    Edit: Wow - many thanks for the gold!  And while I'm at it, I thought it might be interesting to note that this can help explain why people with ADHD are prescribed stimulants when that can seem rather counterintuitive, given the \"hyperactivity\" observed in some individuals.  Stimulants are meant to stimulate the RAS (so it does its job filtering information) so that other parts of the brain are not overwhelmed. Properly filtering this excessive sensory input can help individuals greatly by.. 1) helping 'hyperactive' individuals (who readily respond to distracting stimuli) maintain attention and focus on important tasks, and/or  2) helping 'inattentive' individuals (who are overwhelmed by the excessive noise) get some much deserved peace.": 1.0

You can do a bit of trick by taking advantage of the fact that the earth is already orbiting the sun and using that speed as a base similar to the way you launch from near the equator when leaving earth to take advantage of the earths rotation.  If you do that you fly of in the plane that earth (and all the other planets and stuff) orbit the sun.  You can also take advantage of heavy objects like planets or the sun itself to fling yourself outwards by first letting yourself get pulled in by their gravity. To slingshot like this you need to get near them.  You totally don't have to do any of that. It just saves fuel.

Reading conflicting info. 37F, no medications, allergy to penicillin, anxiety disorder, lives in Alabama.  I'm not sure which vaccine it was but she broke out in hives and started freaking out on the phone when she called me. She has huge health anxiety. I suspect she broke out in hives from her anxiety but I'm not sure.  They gave her some benadryl and kept her longer. She ended up being fine so that means she will probably be fine getting the second one right?

Any solid vibranium object of sufficient size to accomodate those waves should exhibit similar properties, with the pulse shape being dependent on the shape of the vibranium object.   Ultron was made of many distinct pieces of vibranium. So instead of supporting wave build up the momentum is distributed between all of the different pieces. Because the mass energy dispersal mechanism is dependent on those waves, a collection of smaller vibranium pieces can't shed the momentum the way Cap's shield can.

I understand many Europeans rely on Russian exports (especially oil) so trade restrictions are difficult. And if I recall, they are only excluded for doping violations at the Olympics. Plus there is an inconsistent application to property seizure and I don't think travel is restricted for most.     Invading a sovereign country should immediately have consequences.  Enforcing this would be difficult. But I imagine most democratic countries working as a group would sign on immediately. The same democratic countries that enjoy healthy tourism and investments from Russia. Or maybe it already exists and is not enforced.\n### Comment:\n",

Can police legally enter your property without you being home in Ohio? I was called by a detective to address some issues in my apartment seen on the building cameras (Im a night Janitor in my building). When I got home, the detective was already in my apartment, let in by the maintenance people of my apartment building. It took me approximately 10 minutes from the time I was called to get back home. So im just curious if this is legal, there were no charges for anything, I wasnt arrested. They were just in my apartment waiting on me to talk to me about the somethings seen on the camera (Peoples packages coming up missing, and so forth). So, just curious if this is legal for them to have gained access to my apartment without me being present?\n### Comment:\n",

A common dish is a lemon cream sauce.  But no mater how hard I try at home I can\u2019t get that infused deep flavor.  I bought some lemon extract and that helped a bit.  Of course I use zest as recipes call for.  Once I added extra juice but then it tasted to \u2018tangy\u2019 as opposed to the more developed flavors I\u2019ve had at restaurants.   Any tricks/tips??   Thanks!!\n### Comment:\n",

            "NOAA has some good information on this: http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/currents/06conveyor.html  Might be kid friendly, I didn't look at it too closely other than to check it had the relevant diagrams.  Basically every couple thousand years all the water in the oceans is filtered through the crust at some point and recirculated up through deepsea vents in the crust (your famous black and white smokers). Bodies of water in different parts of the oceans, like near Antarctica, cool and because ice forms, drawing the freshwater out of the ocean, the rest of the water becomes super salty/more dense and \"sinks\" beneath warmer surface waters and then continue to flow on the ocean floor. Continents make things complicated and end up with a global ocean conveyor belt situation where you could, theoretically, deploy a drifter that matched the density of its surrounding water and flowed around the entire Ocean (capitalized, signifying the global body of water).": 0.0,
            "To add to /u/Ohairreddit69, whom is correct. In regards to the hadal region, Mariana Trench, we currently do not know we have a few theories but have no direct measurements. I am currently working on figuring this out. One theory is that no there is no circulation in the trench and the water would be the saltiest coldest (most dense) water produced during the last glacial max, and no other water is dense enough to replace it. The other theory is that internal wave that propagate in not just the horizontal but also have a vertical component are mixing the water. If the slope of the trench is just right these waves can be reflected down into the trench mixing the water until homogeny is achieved, similar situations have been found in shallow canyons all over the world.

Do they affect the water at the bottom of areas like the Mariana Trench? I was wondering if the water that sits at the bottom of some of the deepest trenches ever circulates with the rest of the water above it. Or is the water that's down there now, the same water that's been down there for thousands of years?\n### Comment:\n",

            "I dont think any of the answers so far are actually any good. I'm just gonna reply to them all here.      **Better Accuracy:** That makes sense if they were rifled projectiles, but they're not. Hell, most of the time everyone is shooting from the hip. Even if they weren't, the rifle doesnt exactly have sights, instead it has some giant bump on the top that would do nothing besides block your view.      **Better Range:** Starfleet is a spaceship fleet, not a bunch of marines invading beaches. They need a range of \"to the end of the hallway\". But even then, I've never seen an instance where the hand phase shot died and dissipated before it got to its target.      **Holds More Shots:** Has a phaser ever run out of shots? I'm happy to be proven wrong, and that sounds like a good idea for a scene. If anyone can link that to me that would be great. Also, I've never seen the communicators get recharged, so I'm assuming that 24th century batteries have plenty of storage.      **Faster Rate of Fire:** Its a beam of light, not a mechanically powered gun. Hold the button down.       **Different Modes and Power Settings:** Its software, I'm sure the phaser can install that update.      The only thing I could really see is that a rifle would have a larger power bank and be able to dump it faster. Basically it can act like a plasma torch for longer than phaser.": 0.0,
            "In-lore it's implied that the rifle has different modes - It's shown twice that it has multiple modes (DS9 - Return To Grace, for example), it can be used as what we might think of as a shotgun one moment and the next it could project a wide bean able to harm a biological organism in a room, and you could finish this by using it as a marksman's rifle. and some kind of sight attached for long-range fire.   As the others have said thought, it is also the practical reality of having, say, a brace or stock added to a pistol.": 1.0

            "There are proper ways to be sad, angry, upset, etc. You learn how to let these emotions run their course in an effective, safe way.  Think of it like a guitar. A guitar has six strings. There are six basic emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, jealousy, disgust. A guitar played properly can convey a wonder of emotional tunes. Melodies can make you happy, sad, what have you. However, this only is possible if the instrument is played properly, the strings understood, and chords played correctly. If someone picks up a guitar and just starts mindlessly strumming, the tune is unbearable, no emotion is elicited, and people avoid it. The improperly played guitar is the person not properly \"playing\" their emotions. It is pure spontaneity with no direction whatsoever. You can learn to be whatever emotion you have. Swell with pride, shake with anger, cry when your sad. Find the melody that best fits your emotion and play it.": 0.0,
            "\"process\" is just a way to say \"think about what is really going on and making you feel this way.\"  There are several reasons that \"processing\" emotions is recommended, with a very important one being that emotions are generally what are called \"primitive\" responses, the body is reacting to biochemical inputs. \"Processing\" forces you out of the biochemical response mode and into the logical consciousness zone.  Thinking about your emotional state is a way to induce a delay in response and to exercise some control on that response.  Those chemical releases are generally a response to the brain's instructions.  The brain has made some decisions, typically automatic response using learned behaviors, and caused the dumping of chemicals into the bloodstream, so processing emotions also helps you figure out what is TRULY responsible for your emotional response.  This sort of evaluation is used in Cognitive Therapy, which is basically an attempt to get the person to see what is the source of their emotional responses and how to counter the effects when exposed to such sources, and/or how to avoid or minimize the impact of exposure to such sources.   The primary purpose of being advised to \"Process\" your emotions is to remove your actions from your learned (trained) set of responses`to place a small delay into the mix, give you time to reduce the intensity of your response.  Sort of like counting to 10.  The secondary reason is so you can figure out what the heck the real problems are and what to do to make things less disruptive to you.  You can't \"fix\" something if you do not know what is truly the problem.  My problem was anger and let me tell you, letting anger take control is not a good thing.  Took a lot of work to retrain myself.": 1.0

            "Something I don't think I saw mentioned is the administrative creep of higher ed.  Universities used to be largely run through a process of shared governance where faculty had a major voice in the running of a university.  Faculty generally have preferences to spend university resources on teaching and research.  This voice has greatly eroded over time.  I have served on many executive level search committees and they will talk about there being an academic side and a business side and that faculty should have no voice in the business operations of a university.  What this also means is that faculty have little to no voice in the budget of a university.    I've been at 5 different universities, and all of them had a rough budget breakdown of about 1/3 toward academics and 2/3 toward non-academics.  That 2/3 also controls the budget and those people are business people.  They are lawyers, accountants, finance, MBAs, HR, marketing, all the same type people you see running any other business or non-profit.  We have people freely move between us and a hospital system or a large corporation or any other large organization.  They run the university and many (yes I'm stereotyping, but I have run into too many of these) have disdain for the faculty and students.  Their job is to audit books or check off compliance reports and the academic mission of the institution just makes their job harder to do.  So it all becomes about a mindset.  The people really running universities run it like a business because they are the people that also run businesses.": 1.0
