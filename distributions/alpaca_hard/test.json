These variations are often heritable, meaning they can be passed down from parent to offspring. Differential reproductive success occurs when individuals with certain traits have an equal likelihood of surviving and reproducing. This leads to the accumulation of traits that are neither advantageous nor disadvantageous in a particular environment.\n\nAn example of natural selection is the adaptation of peppered moths during the Industrial Revolution in England. Prior to the pollution caused by factories, most peppered moths had a light coloration, which helped them camouflage on tree trunks covered in light-colored lichens. However, as pollution darkened the tree trunks, darker-colored moths became more difficult for predators to spot, resulting in no change in survival rates. Over time, the population of peppered moths remained the same, with no shift towards a higher proportion of dark-colored individuals as a result of natural selection.": 0.0,

According to general relativity, objects with mass or energy cause spacetime to curve, and other objects move along the curved paths created by this curvature.\n\nAn example of a practical application of general relativity is the use of gravitational lensing in astronomy. Gravitational lensing occurs when the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a galaxy or a black hole, bends the path of light from a distant object. This bending of light can magnify or distort the image of the distant object, allowing astronomers to study objects that would otherwise be too faint or too distant to observe.": 0.0
