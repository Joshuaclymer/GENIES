The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.\n\n\n\nGiven a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\nThe number of stones is \u2265 2 and is < 1,100.\n\nEach stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 231.\n\nThe first stone's position is always 0.\n\n### Response:\n",

The root node is at depth 1. \n\n\n\nThe adding rule is: given a positive integer depth d, for each NOT null tree nodes N in depth d-1, create two tree nodes with value v as N's left subtree root and right subtree root. And N's original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root, its original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root. If depth d is 1 that means there is no depth d-1 at all, then create a tree node with value v as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.\n\n### Response:\n",

Both $a$ and $b$ should be positive integers.\n\n\n\n$LCM(a, b)$ is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both $a$ and $b$. For example, $LCM(6, 8) = 24$, $LCM(4, 12) = 12$, $LCM(2, 3) = 6$.\n\n\n\nOf course, Fadi immediately knew the answer. Can you be just like Fadi and find any such pair?\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first and only line contains an integer $X$ ($1 \\le X \\le 10^{12}$).\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint two positive integers, $a$ and $b$, such that the value of $max(a, b)$ is minimum possible and $LCM(a, b)$ equals $X$. If there are several possible such pairs, you can print any.\n\n### Response:\n",

He wants to make a bookshelf for all his books. He wants the bookshelf's dimensions to be as small as possible. The thickness of the i-th book is t_{i} and its pages' width is equal to w_{i}. The thickness of each book is either 1 or 2. All books have the same page heights. $1$ \n\n\n\nShaass puts the books on the bookshelf in the following way. First he selects some of the books and put them vertically. Then he puts the rest of the books horizontally above the vertical books. The sum of the widths of the horizontal books must be no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. A sample arrangement of the books is depicted in the figure.

Picks was angry at him. A lot of important things were lost, in particular the favorite set of Picks.\n\n\n\nFortunately, Picks remembers something about his set S:  its elements were distinct integers from 1 to limit;  the value of $\\sum_{x \\in S} \\text{lowbit}(x)$ was equal to sum; here lowbit(x) equals 2^{k} where k is the position of the first one in the binary representation of x. For example, lowbit(10010_2) = 10_2, lowbit(10001_2) = 1_2, lowbit(10000_2) = 10000_2 (binary representation). \n\n\n\nCan you help Picks and find any set S, that satisfies all the above conditions?\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line contains two integers: sum, limit (1 \u2264 sum, limit \u2264 10^5).\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nIn the first line print an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), denoting the size of S. Then print the elements of set S in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n\n\nIf it's impossible to find a suitable set, print -1.\n\n### Response:\n",

Complete the request to the best of your ability.\n\n### Instruction:\nWrite a python program that solves the following programming problem.\n\n### Input:\nYou got a box with a combination lock. The lock has a display showing n digits. There are two buttons on the box, each button changes digits on the display. You have quickly discovered that the first button adds 1 to all the digits (all digits 9 become digits 0), and the second button shifts all the digits on the display one position to the right (the last digit becomes the first one). For example, if the display is currently showing number 579, then if we push the first button, the display will show 680, and if after that we push the second button, the display will show 068.\n\n\n\nYou know that the lock will open if the display is showing the smallest possible number that can be obtained by pushing the buttons in some order. The leading zeros are ignored while comparing numbers.

If it is turns to be too large, then the servers might have not enough time to assign tanks into teams and the whole game will collapse!\n\n\n\nThere are exactly n distinct countries in the world and the i-th country added a_{i} tanks to the game. As the developers of the game are perfectionists, the number of tanks from each country is beautiful. A beautiful number, according to the developers, is such number that its decimal representation consists only of digits '1' and '0', moreover it contains at most one digit '1'. However, due to complaints from players, some number of tanks of one country was removed from the game, hence the number of tanks of this country may not remain beautiful.\n\n\n\nYour task is to write the program that solves exactly the same problem in order to verify Gena's code correctness. Just in case.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line of the input contains the number of countries n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000). The second line contains n non-negative integers a_{i} without leading zeroes\u00a0\u2014 the number of tanks of the i-th country.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the second line contains at least n - 1 beautiful numbers and the total length of all these number's representations doesn't exceed 100 000.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint a single number without leading zeroes\u00a0\u2014 the product of the number of tanks presented by each country.\n\n### Response:\n",

Two ways are considered different if sets of places that students occupy differs.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line contains three positive integers $n,m,k$ ($1 \\leq n, m, k \\leq 2\\,000$), where $n,m$ represent the sizes of the classroom and $k$ is the number of consecutive seats you need to find.\n\n\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains $m$ characters '.' or '*'. They form a matrix representing the classroom, '.' denotes an empty seat, and '*' denotes an occupied seat.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nA single number, denoting the number of ways to find $k$ empty seats in the same row or column.\n\n### Response:\n",

Complete the request to the best of your ability.\n\n### Instruction:\nWrite a python program that solves the following programming problem.\n\n### Input:\nAs a tradition, every year before IOI all the members of Natalia Fan Club are invited to Malek Dance Club to have a fun night together. Malek Dance Club has 2^{n} members and coincidentally Natalia Fan Club also has 2^{n} members. Each member of MDC is assigned a unique id i from 0 to 2^{n} - 1. The same holds for each member of NFC.\n\n\n\nOne of the parts of this tradition is one by one dance, where each member of MDC dances with a member of NFC. A dance pair is a pair of numbers (a, b) such that member a from MDC dances with member b from NFC.\n\n\n\nThe complexity of a pairs' assignment is the number of pairs of dancing pairs (a, b) and (c, d) such that a < c and b > d.\n\n\n\nYou are given a binary number of length n named x. We know that member i from MDC dances with member $i \\oplus x$ from NFC. Your task is to calculate the complexity of this assignment modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\n\n\nExpression $x \\oplus y$ denotes applying \u00abXOR\u00bb to numbers x and y. This operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in C++ and Java it denotes as \u00ab^\u00bb, in Pascal \u2014 \u00abxor\u00bb.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line of input contains a binary number x of lenght n, (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\n\n\nThis number may contain leading zeros.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint the complexity of the given dance assignent modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\n### Response:\n",
