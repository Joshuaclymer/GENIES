Each turn he does the following:  Ivan chooses any non-empty box and takes all balls from this box;  Then Ivan chooses any k empty boxes (the box from the first step becomes empty, and Ivan is allowed to choose it), separates the balls he took on the previous step into k non-empty groups and puts each group into one of the boxes. He should put each group into a separate box. He can choose either k = 2 or k = 3. \n\n\n\nThe penalty of the turn is the number of balls Ivan takes from the box during the first step of the turn. And penalty of the game is the total penalty of turns made by Ivan until he distributes all balls to corresponding boxes.\n\n\n\nHelp Ivan to determine the minimum possible penalty of the game!\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line contains one integer number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200000) \u2014 the number of boxes and colors.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9), where a_{i} is the number of balls with color i.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\n\n\nPrint one number \u2014 the minimum possible penalty of the game.\n\n### Response:\n",

Complete the request to the best of your ability.\n\n### Instruction:\nWrite a python program that solves the following programming problem.\n\n### Input:\nConsider a rooted tree. A rooted tree has one special vertex called the root. All edges are directed from the root. Vertex u is called a child of vertex v and vertex v is called a parent of vertex u if there exists a directed edge from v to u. A vertex is called a leaf if it doesn't have children and has a parent.\n\n\n\nLet's call a rooted tree a spruce if its every non-leaf vertex has at least 3 leaf children. You are given a rooted tree, check whether it's a spruce.\n\n\n\nThe definition of a rooted tree can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\n\n\nThe first line contains one integer n\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree (3 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000). Each of the next n - 1 lines contains one integer p_{i} (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n - 1)\u00a0\u2014 the index of the parent of the i + 1-th vertex (1 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 i).\n\n\n\nVertex 1 is the root.
