For example, given the list [1, 2, 3, -4, 5, -6, 7, -8], the maximum sum of two non-overlapping subarrays is 17 (from the subarrays [2, 3, -4, 5] and [7]).\nThen I wrote this code:\ndef max_sum_two_subarrays(nums):\n    n = len(nums) + 1\n    \n    left = [0]*n\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    curr_sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        curr_sum = max(nums[i], curr_sum + nums[i])\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)\n        left[i] = max_sum\n    \n    right = [0]*n\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    curr_sum = 0\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        curr_sum = max(nums[i], curr_sum + nums[i])\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)\n        right[i] = max_sum\n    \n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    for i in range(n-2):\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, left[i+1] + right[i])\n\n    return max_sum\nI'm very proud of my work.
